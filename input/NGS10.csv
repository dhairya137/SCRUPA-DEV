9706552,"Title: ?Console Upgrade and Cryogenic Probe for a 500 MHz NMR System for Biomedical Research?. Project Summary/Abstract: The Mary L. Vanier Biomolecular NMR Facility at Kansas State University, which has served more than 30 separate NIH-funded research projects and several other life sciences research groups (Total 45), requests partial funding to replace an obsolete Varian 500 MHz NMR system (originally purchased in 1993) with a newer console and a 5 mm cryogenic-probe. This upgrade will provide NMR instrumentation essential for studying proteins or protein domains structure and dynamics, and the relation of these to protein function. The new purchase will improve the research capabilities at Kansas State University (KSU) in numerous NIH funded collaborative projects covering a broad range of biomedical research including cancer, inflammation, viral and insect-borne diseases. The research in these areas is severely hampered by lack of suitable biomolecular NMR equipment availability to NIH-funded biomedical researchers (Drs. Kanost, Chang, Geisbrecht, Roelofs, Park, Ganta, Prakash, Zolkiewski and others from division of biology and diagnostic medicine) at our campus. Currently an outmoded Varian 500 NMR spectrometer is the sole instrument for performing protein NMR studies at this campus. This instrument is unable to execute the required 2D and 3D heteronuclear NMR experiments. Many of our local NIH supported researchers are forced to go to distant facilities for 2D and 3D NMR studies on their samples. Therefore, we propose to replace our current obsolete Varian console and cold probe with a Bruker BioSpin AVANCE NEO console and a triple resonance cryogenic-probe. The choice of Bruker is based on performance of electronics and the compatibility of the current Oxford 500 MHz magnet. Our request for replacing the current console and cold-probe is also justified due to following reasons: 1) Lack of appropriate service, parts and repair for our 500 MHz Varian NMR console and cold-probe from original manufacturer ( Withdrawal of Varian and now Agilent Technologies Inc. from the NMR market.); 2) Catastrophic failure of triple resonance cold-probe and extreme difficulties in its repairing; 3) Inability to perform 2D and 3D triple resonance experiments essential for protein NMR studies; and 4) Many of our biological NMR samples are limited due to low expression levels of proteins, low solubility, or short-lived stability, requiring higher sensitivity and rapid data collection. Overall, the new purchase will not only replace an obsolete console equipped with a cold-probe, but will provide a shared instrumentation necessary to complete more than ten on-going NIH-funded research projects at Kansas State University. This acquisition will benefit basic, comparative, and translational research in a substantial way and will undoubtedly help the entire campus biomedical community including the College of Veterinary Medicine.","PRAKASH, OM ;",Console Upgrade and Cryogenic Probe for a 500 MHz NMR System for Biomedical Research,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,8/9/2019,8/8/2020,3-Dimensional; Area; base; Biological; Biological Sciences; Biology; Biomedical Research; Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; college; Communities; comparative; cryogenics; Data Collection; Diagnostic; Disease; Distant; Electronics; Equipment; experimental study; Failure; Funding; Heteronuclear NMR; improved; Inflammation; Insecta; instrument; instrumentation; Kansas; Malignant Neoplasms; Manufacturer Name; Medicine; NMR Spectroscopy; Performance; protein function; Proteins; repaired; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Sampling; Services; Solubility; Structure; System; Technology; Tertiary Protein Structure; Translational Research; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Veterinary Medicine; Viral; Withdrawal; ,MANHATTAN,UNITED STATES
9513933,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 10% of women in Western populations experience early natural menopause, defined as menopause before age 45. Early menopause can significantly impact women's psychological and physical health, as the early cessation of ovarian function influences fertility and family planning, and increases risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and other chronic conditions. The ability to identify women at risk for early menopause prior to the onset of decline in reproductive function would improve options for treatment and prevention. Accurate prediction of early menopause is dependent upon the identification of all biochemical, reproductive, dietary and lifestyle factors that are importantly associated with risk. Large prospective studies evaluating multiple risk factors simultaneously are needed, but few have been conducted. Finding from these studies can not only improve clinical prediction but can provide insight into whether risk of early menopause is modifiable and declines in reproductive function in high-risk women can be slowed.  We propose to determine how biochemical, reproductive, dietary and lifestyle factors are related to risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women, aged 25-42 at cohort inception in 1989. Early menopause was experienced by more than 3,500 NHS2 participants over 24 years of follow-up, including 500 women who provided a blood sample up to 15 years prior to menopause. In this project, we will first evaluate whether anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) predicts risk of early menopause, comparing levels in 500 women with early natural menopause to levels in 500 matched controls with menopause at e age 48. Second, we will expand knowledge of the etiology of early menopause by evaluating prospectively how risk is related to the following: 1) inflammation markers including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 2 levels; 2) total and bioavailable 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels; and 3) reproductive, dietary and lifestyle factors. Third, we will determine whether biochemical and behavioral factors are themselves associated with baseline AMH levels and rate of AMH decline over 10-14 years. Finally, we will develop prediction and etiologic models for early menopause that incorporate all of this information.  Our study in the NHS2 will be among the first to evaluate prospectively how biochemical, reproductive, dietary and lifestyle factors collectively relate to early menopause. To our knowledge, it will be the first to investigate whether vitamin D and inflammatory factors are associated with risk of early menopause, and among the first to address whether women at high risk for early menopause may be able to slow early decline in reproductive function. This work is an important first step in developing novel interventions, which can then be tested in clinical trials. Results from this study may have important implications for fertility preservation and for improved prevention of cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in at-risk women.","BERTONE-JOHNSON, ELIZABETH R;",Predictors of Early Menopause,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,9/17/14,6/30/20,25-hydroxyvitamin D; Address; Affect; Age; aged; Behavioral; Bioavailable; Biochemical; Biochemical Markers; Blood specimen; Breast Feeding; C-reactive protein; cardiovascular disorder prevention; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cohort; Contraceptive Usage; Development; Dietary Factors; early experience; Etiology; experience; Family Planning; Fertility; fertility preservation; follow-up; Glycoproteins; granulosa cell; high risk; High Risk Woman; Hormones; improved; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; insight; Intake; Interleukin-6; Intervention; Isoflavones; Knowledge; lifestyle factors; member; Menopause; Mental Health; Modeling; Moderate Exercise; novel; Nurses' Health Study; Obesity; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Oral Contraceptives; Osteoporosis; Ovarian; Ovarian aging; Ovulation; parity; Participant; Physical activity; physical conditioning; Plasma; Population; Predictive Factor; Premature Menopause; Prevention; prospective; Prospective Studies; public health relevance; reproductive function; Reproductive History; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Smoking; Testing; TNFRSF1A gene; Underweight; Vegetable Proteins; Vitamin D; Woman; Work; ,HADLEY,UNITED STATES
9622596,"Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm.","CASTRO-GONZALEZ, CARLOS ;",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",7/12/18,6/30/20,Accident and Emergency department; Adverse effects; Algorithms; Antibiotics; Area; Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation; base; Blinded; Blood capillaries; Blood specimen; Cancer Patient; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Classification; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; cohort; Colony-Stimulating Factors; Computer Vision Systems; computerized data processing; cost; Data; Data Analyses; Data Set; Databases; deep learning; Detection; Development; Devices; Diagnostic; Dose; experience; Fever; fighting; Fingers; FPS-FES Oncogene; Frequencies; Generations; Goals; Grant; Growth; Health; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hematology; Home environment; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Hour; Human; Imaging Device; Immunosuppression; improved; Incidence; Infection; Intervention; Interview; Label; learning strategy; Letters; Leukocytes; Life; Malignant Neoplasms; man; Manuals; Measurement; Medical; Microcirculation; Monitor; mortality; movie; Neutropenia; neutrophil; non-invasive optical imaging; Nurses; oncology; optical imaging; Patients; Performance; personalized chemotherapy; Phase; Physicians; Pilot Projects; point of care; portability; Process; prophylactic; prototype; Proxy; Risk; ROC Curve; Safety; Sample Size; Sampling; Sensitivity and Specificity; Site; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; System; Systems Analysis; Technology; Testing; Time; Training; Triage; Validation; Visit; ,CAMBRIDGE,UNITED STATES
9767746,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. The age-adjusted mortality rate of this cancer is more than 40% higher in African Americans (AAs) than in whites for reasons poorly understood. Since 2007, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in Asian and European descendants have identified nearly 100 susceptibility loci for this cancer. However, only a few of the initially identified risk variants can be directly replicated in AAs due to a small sample sizein previous studies and racial differences in genetic architectures and genetic/environmental modifiers. GWAS are often not equipped to study structural variants and are inefficient for capturing low-frequency variants. These variants, although virtually uninvestigated to date, are believed to contribute substantially to the heritability of breast cancer and other complex traits, particularly in African-ancestry populations. Furthermore, compared with Asian- and European-ancestry populations, the African-ancestry genome is much more heterogeneous and thus more informative, particularly as we expand the scope of genetic studies from common to less-common variants using next-generation sequencing technology. Herein, we propose a large consortium study in AAs to systematically search the whole genome to discover novel genetic             susceptibility factors for breast cancer and further evaluate the influence of germline risk variants on breast cancer biology. Nearly 20,000 AA breast cancer patients and an equal number of controls will be included in this study. In Stage 1, we propose to sequence the whole genome for 1,200 breast cancer cases and 600 controls for association analyses. We will then use these sequencing data, along with data from other sources, to build a novel, comprehensive reference panel for imputation and meta-analysis of approximately 6,300 cases and 6,300 controls genotyped in four previous GWAS conducted in African-ancestry populations. We will utilize publically available genetic data, including functional genomic data, to enhance the abilit of the two aforementioned analyses to identify promising breast cancer susceptibility genes and variants for replication. In Stage 2, we will replicate approximately 60,000 promising variants in 5,500 cases and 5,500 controls. Genes/variants which show a promising association in Stage 2 will be evaluated further in Stage 3, including two additional stages (3A and 3B) in approximately 7,500 cases and 7,500 controls. Finally, we will use gene expression signatures to evaluate how germline risk variants identified in this study and previous studies affect the major signaling pathways of breast cancer. This proposed study will generate critically needed data in AAs to improve the understanding of the genetics, biology, and etiology of breast cancer.","HAIMAN, CHRISTOPHER ALAN; PALMER, JULIE R; ZHENG, WEI  (contact);",Breast Cancer genetic study in African-ancestry populations,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,7/1/2016,6/30/2021,Address; Affect; African; African American; Age; Asians; base; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biology; Breast Cancer Genetics; Breast Cancer Patient; Breast Cancer Prevention; Breast Cancer Risk Factor; Budgets; Cancer Biology; cancer therapy; Cancer-Predisposing Gene; Collaborations; Complex; cost efficient; Custom; Data; Data Analyses; design; Diagnosis; Disease; Estrogen receptor negative; Estrogen receptor positive; Etiology; European; Evaluation; Frequencies; functional genomics; Future; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic; genetic architecture; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Risk; genetic risk factor; Genetic study; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; Genome; genome sequencing; genome wide association study; genomic data; Genotype; Hereditary Breast Carcinoma; Heritability; High Risk Woman; improved; Incidence; Investigation; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Meta-Analysis; Methodology; Methods; molecular subtypes; mortality; nano-string; new technology; next generation sequencing; novel; Pathway interactions; Penetrance; Play; Population; public health relevance; Race; racial difference; racial disparity; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Risk Assessment; risk variant; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; Signal Pathway; SNP array; Source; Statistical Methods; Structure; Susceptibility Gene; Technology; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Tissue Sample; trait; transcriptome sequencing; United States; Variant; virtual; whole genome; Woman; ,NASHVILLE,UNITED STATES

The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm.","CASTRO-GONZALEZ, CARLOS ;",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",07/12/2018,06/30/2020,Accident and Emergency department; Algorithms; Antibiotics; Area; Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation; base; Blinded; Blood capillaries; Blood specimen; Cancer Patient; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Classification; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; cohort; Colony-Stimulating Factors; Computer Vision Systems; computerized data processing; cost; Data; Data Analyses; Data Set; Databases; deep learning; deep learning algorithm; Detection; Development; Devices; Diagnostic; Dose; experience; Fever; fighting; Fingers; FPS-FES Oncogene; Frequencies; Generations; Goals; Grant; Growth; Health; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hematology; Home environment; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Hour; Human; Imaging Device; Immunosuppression; improved; Incidence; Infection; infection risk; Intervention; Interview; Label; learning strategy; Letters; Leukocytes; Life; Malignant Neoplasms; man; Manuals; Measurement; Medical; Microcirculation; Monitor; mortality; movie; Neutropenia; neutrophil; non-invasive system; non-invasive optical imaging; Nurses; oncology; optical imaging; Patients; Performance; personalized chemotherapy; Phase; Physicians; Pilot Projects; point of care; portability; Process; prophylactic; prototype; Proxy; Risk; ROC Curve; Safety; Sample Size; Sampling; Sensitivity and Specificity; side effect; Site; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; System; Systems Analysis; Technology; Testing; Time; Training; Treatment Side Effects; Triage; Validation; Visit; ,CAMBRIDGE,UNITED STATES
9848432,"SUMMARY The standard of care for genetic testing of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and Lynch syndrome is based on guidelines from the NCCN. The paradigm was developed based on the principle that genetic testing was expensive and that the incidence of these syndromes was low. Over the past twenty years the price of testing has fallen dramatically and it is now recognized that both HBOC and Lynch syndrome are relatively common (joint incidence of about 1 in 200). Many individuals in the population are affected by HBOC or Lynch but come from small families with few female relatives. Given the decreases in family size that have occurred over the past 50 years this is becoming a common situation. It is estimated that only 20% of those affected by HBOC are aware of their condition. Overall, there is a significant unmet need for those with HBOC and Lynch syndrome to be identified so they can have the opportunity for appropriate medical care. What we need are approaches that can rapidly, accurately, and inexpensively identify those with inherited cancer syndromes. The costs of sequencing have fallen dramatically and members of our team have QIAseq based targeted resequencing platforms for germline studies that dramatically lower the cost of panel based sequencing while allowing easy, rapid multiplexing. The costs of testing will be near $90 per sample. We have taken the task of developing a strategy that can be applied to detect HBOC and Lynch syndromes in broader populations. We will study the effectiveness of population scale testing of these two syndromes by enrolling 27,500 individuals, who are (a) eligible for inherited cancer syndrome testing (2,500) (b) have had cancer but are not covered by current screening guidelines to receive a low cost genetic screen (7,500) or (c) healthy (17,500). Those individuals identified to have Lynch or HBOC will be followed for outcomes and compared to a matched cohort identified following standard screening guidelines. Additionally, relatives of those identified will be enrolled in cascade screening. We will determine if testing either cancer patients or the general population represents a sustainable strategy for population screening based on QALY measurements.","SHANNON, JACKILEN ; SPELLMAN, PAUL T.
