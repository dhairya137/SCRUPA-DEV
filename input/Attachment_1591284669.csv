"GoDaddy is exceptionally well-known in the hosting space, typically serving as site owners' introduction to the world of web hosting. The company makes it incredibly easy and affordable for folks to choose a domain name, sign up for hosting, and start building their online business or personal web property. While known for its domain, email, and shared hosting services, GoDaddy offers options for virtual and dedicated servers as well. The company makes the upgrade process as seamless as possible, so you shouldn't shy away from scaling your site as your business needs grow; GoDaddy is a hosting home that will grow alongside you.

The user control options are pretty popular in the hosting space: your choice between the easy-to-use cPanel or Plesk control panels, plus root (administrative) access for more tech-savvy customers. If you're particularly interested in webmail, GoDaddy offers an intuitive interface for keeping up with the unlimited email accounts you have available to you as a customer. All of this can be easily accessed and secured with your GoDaddy login info that you receive upon sign-up.

Customer support has been a focus of the GoDaddy team of late. Today, the team has an award-winning collection of experts on staff, readily available to handle customer support tickets and emails 24 hours a day, seven days a week. While they're on hand to talk you through any issues, they're also keeping an eye on your server (as well as other clients sharing your server). The company's around-the-clock security monitoring enables GoDaddy to guarantee uptime rates of 99.9% or better. This uptime rate is by no means outstanding in the industry, but for most end users, it's all that's required. 

The bottom line is this: GoDaddy is a go-to domain web host for millions of users worldwide for a reason. The company maintains an ever-expanding network of users by offering blazing-fast load times, award-winning security and support, and a free domain name when you sign up for a year-long plan.

 GoDaddy has long been the go-to solution for beginners just starting out with web hosting. The company's newly released and simplified interface, 1-click application installs, and upgraded support means we can recommend them with confidence. GoDaddy relies on familiar and user-friendly platforms, such as cPanel, Softaculous, CentOS, and Microsoft Office 365, that customers are sure to appreciate. A streamlined drag-and-drop site builder and extensive knowledgebase, coupled with around-the-clock support, mean anyone can design, create, launch, and grow a site within minutes. &quot;Economy&quot; Plan: $1.00/month &quot;Deluxe&quot; Plan: $4.99/month &quot;Ultimate&quot; Plan: $5.99/month Pricing for GoDaddy hosting is very economical at every level, particularly when you consider all the free perks included with the low prices. The company's shared hosting naturally lead the charge on cost-effective hosting, but budget-minded customers can find surprising deals with upgraded VPS and dedicated server plans, as well. The 99.9% uptime guarantee makes it difficult for us to rank GoDaddy among the top providers of the hosting world, as that rate is largely considered the minimum standard in the industry. For most users, however, 99.9% uptime is absolutely plenty. If your website or application requires a higher guaranteed uptime rate, you should consider more premier (and higher priced) hosts or upgraded services. godaddy Includes: 24/7 Phone, Chat, Twitter, and Email Support, Extensive Online Help Center, and Ticketing System To recap, here's a rundown of what GoDaddy has to offer: GoDaddy is a good value in the hosting space — boasting a very low cost for shared hosting services and long-standing credibility in the domain hosting industry. With hosting available for as little as a dollar per month, it's hard to beat the company's price point. By recently revamping its user interface to improve the customer experience, GoDaddy is taking user-friendliness and responsive support to new heights. The company's around-the-clock service features 24/7 server monitoring and an emphasis on balancing performance and security. Although GoDaddy's uptime guarantee isn't outstanding, the company's page load speeds and general reliability are impressive. All in all, GoDaddy is a reliable option to accommodate your hosting needs."
My account # is ******97 and I have lost my two factor authentication. I requested through your digital plat form for turn off the two factor authentication. Your employees are so stupid and helpless people handlining my case. No one helping me instead of asking stupid questions. I am ending the long relationship with godaddy and I am closing other business accounts with godaddy.
Bad
"Dreadful company. Stole my money and refused to talk to me. 5 times i have asked to speak to a manager, and they have promised to call me back in 72 hours, and never did. They stole £47.95 from my credit card. (For services i never signed up for) I have already spent days on the phone pressing numbers and trying to get through to a manager. (All other staff say i need a manager) I have now given up, as i have spent more time then the money is worth. I have considered taking them to court.. but again its not worth the costs of taking them to court over £47.95. GoDaddy = Thieves. Simple as that. I&#039;m very unhappy, and they wont even talk to me. Im still waiting for you to call me GoDaddy.."
Smart line rocks
AVOID AT ALL COSTS GO TO WORDPRESS OR WIX etc!!! Absolutely the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with! Renewed my &quot;website builder&quot; without informing me that they were going to charge me £7.99 for an old version when the new version only costs £5.99. Not only that but when I came to renew this year they were unable to transfer my website from the &quot;old&quot; version to the &quot;new&quot; verison as they are not compatible and said I will need to start from scratch again. Customer service said that&#039;s just how it is and they are sorry about that. Of course I will not do that so will go elsewhere! There are many great website builders that only cost £2-3 so I highly recommend avoiding this pathetic service and using a better company. You will find it much cheaper too!!
Very nice and relevant support
There creams are good value the company are efficient well good packaging .
Social media advisor just kept sending a link that didn&#039;t deal with my issue and then started referring me to an online chat service that didn&#039;t work. I am now at the point of just being ignored. Absolutely terrible service.
GoDaddy.com had more options and priced better than our last host. Our small business has been using GoDaddy.com webhosting for over 6 years. No issues.I built and designed the site myself and did not use their web building tools. Works good with Dreamweaver.Would recommend.
I am their client for almost 2 years but every time I need support they are not available fast. I have to wait for a long time.
Haven&#039;t much to say. Really happy about your service guys! Use it for my online store and definitely recommend to all
"Deciding your business is ready for a web presence is easy; choosing the right web hosting service is not. GoDaddy is well known as a seller of domain names, and it's also excellent for personal and commercial web hosting purposes. GoDaddy's well-rounded packages fall just shy of those offered by our Editors' Choice picks, but it has many attractive and useful elements that many prospective customers are sure to find worthwhile.Shared Web HostingIf you don't want to spend a lot of money on web hosting, shared hosting is the way to go. This form of cheap web hosting places your website on a server with other sites. So, yes, your site literally shares server resources with others, hence the tier's name. This means that it's far from the most powerful web hosting type, however. The sites sharing the server compete for resources&mdash;everything from throughput to storage space. You'll want dedicated or virtual private server (VPS) hosting for muscle if you expect big traffic, or if you want to insulate yourself from big traffic spikes.GoDaddy has a fine range of Linux- or Windows-based shared web servers. For example, the Economy basic shared hosting package (starts at a $1-per-month introductory rate, renews at $7.99 per month) includes 100GB of storage, the ability to host one website, unlimited monthly data transfers, and a free year of Office 365 Starter Email. Microsoft's mail plan comes with just one email address, but you can upgrade to more accounts for a fee. See the Email Hosting section, below, for more options.The Deluxe plan (starts at $7.99 per month, renews at $10.99 per month) builds on the Economy package by adding unlimited storage and domains. The Ultimate package (starts at a $12.99 per month, renews at $16.99 per month) adds double the processing power and a one-year Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate. FYI, GoDaddy tosses in a free domain name if you sign up for an annual plan.Speaking of long-term plans, GoDaddy offers steep discounts to people who plan to stick around for the long haul. For example, if you sign up for a 10-year Economy Linux shared hosting plan, you pay $718.80, which is 25 percent off the full price.GoDaddy's Economy plan is presented as though you can't sign up for a month-to-month payment plan (the lowest price displayed is for a three-month minimum sign up period), but once you add the plan to the cart, the one-month plan appears. We're glad the option exists, but we do wish it were easier to find. We couldn't find it until a GoDaddy pointed it out after we complained that the option didn't exist in a previous version of this review.GoDaddy has rich shared hosting plans, but HostGator still reigns as the PCMag Editors' Choice for shared web hosting services. Like GoDaddy, HostGator boasts unlimited domains and monthly data transfers across the board, and a choice of Linux- or Windows-based servers, but it tops its rival by offering a VoIP number for your business and unlimited storage with all plans.VPS Web HostingVPS or virtual private server hosting is exactly what it sounds like. You're paying for space on a shared server, but one that does much more to isolate you from your server mates than plain old shared hosting does.Hostwinds may be the PCMag Editors' Choice for VPS hosting, but that doesn't mean that GoDaddy doesn't have quality virtual private server packages. GoDaddy's VPS plans (which start at a $19.99 per month, renews at $29.99 per month) offer Linux- or Windows-based servers, as well as unlimited domains and monthly data transfers. The specs top out at 8GB of RAM, 240GB of storage, and a free SSL for one year. That's good stuff, especially if you sign up for a multi-month plan. The Economy Virtual Private Server plan, for example, drops to just $9.99 per month if you agree to a two-year deal. That's 50 percent off. As with the shared plans, these VPS plans use Office 365 Starter Email.So why does GoDaddy fall short of winning our VPS hosting Editors' Choice award? It's because Hostwinds simply has a wider range of VPS plans. For example, the base VPS starts at just $16.99 per month (for 1GB of RAM, 30GB of disk space, and 1TB of monthly data transfers), while the upper tier scales up to $574 per month (for 96GB of RAM, 750GB of disk space, and 9TB of monthly data transfers).Still, GoDaddy's VPS services are a capable option for people who want a web hosting solution that's more powerful than shared web hosting, but don't want to pay dedicated web hosting's relatively expensive cost.Dedicated Web HostingDedicated hosting is the tier you need when you operate a site that demands lots of system resources. With dedicated hosting, your site exists on a server all by itself, thus leveraging all of the server's power. This is the hardware you need to power a site designed to handle millions of visitors per year.GoDaddy's dedicated servers come in many Linux or Windows configurations. Economy (starts at $89.99 per month, renews at $169 per month) comes with four CPU cores, 4GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, unlimited monthly data transfers, three IP addresses, Office 365 Starter Email, and a free SSL certificate. Value (starts at $104 per month, renews at $199 per month) ups the RAM and storage to 8GB and 1.5TB, respectively. Deluxe (starts at $129 per month, renews at $249 per month) boasts 16GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Ultimate (starts at $179 per month, renews at $349 per month) has a sizeable 32GB of RAM. Naturally, a long-term commitment nets you big savings. For example, if you sign up for 24 months of the Economy plan, you pay just $79.99 per month).GoDaddy's dedicated servers are extremely attractive, but AccuWeb takes the Editors' Choice crown. AccuWeb's servers can be outfitted with up to 512GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and 50TB of monthly data transfers. You can also select either the Linux or Windows operating system.WordPress Web HostingGoDaddy has multiple tiers of unmanaged and managed WordPress hosting. The unmanaged plans have the same prices and specs as GoDaddy's shared plans.The managed variety the white-glove treatment with four tiers of Linux-based WordPress hosting. Signing up has its advantages. GoDaddy has thousands of WordPress themes and plug-ins, and it offers nightly backups and automatic WordPress software updates. Like other managed WordPress hosts, GoDaddy doesn't require you to install the CMS, as it comes preinstalled. Once you're logged into WordPress, you can create posts, pages, and galleries as you would with any other self-hosted WordPress site.The Pro 5 plan (starts at $24.99 per month) comes with five domains, 50GB of storage, five staging areas, site backup (for up to 90 days), and a free SSL certificate. Pro 10 (starts at $49.99 per month) ups the domains to 10, storage to 80GB, and staging areas to 10. Pro 25 (starts at $89.99 per month) builds on Pro 10 by offering 25 domains, 25 staging areas, and 100GB of storage. Pro 50 (starts at $169 per month) serves up 50 domains, 200GB of storage, and 50 staging areas. Please note that the renewal prices are the same as the starting prices.That's a good offering, but A2 reigns as the Editors' Choice for WordPress hosting. A2 has plans starting as low as $7.99 per month (for unlimited storage, unlimited monthly data transfers, and free SSL certificate) and as high as $24.46 per month (which adds unlimited sites and unlimited databases).No Cloud Web HostingGoDaddy lacks cloud hosting, an alternative to traditional hosting that draws resources from multiple servers. If you want to get into cloud hosting, which lets you expand server resources with ease, we suggest taking a look at DreamHost, our co-Editors' Choice in that category.DreamHost's small business-friendly packages start at $4.50 per month (for 512MB of RAM, 100GB of storage, and unlimited monthly data transfers) and top out at $48 per month (for four CPU cores, 8GB of RAM, 100GB of storage, and unlimited monthly data transfers). If you're just dabbling in cloud hosting, DreamHost is a fine place to start.Heavily trafficked sites will favor 1&amp;1 Ionos . The co-Editors' Choice has the specs (16-core CPUs, 48GB of RAM) and prorated plans that big businesses crave. In addition, 1&amp;1 Ionos offers customizable servers that you can build from the ground up. Those, of course, cost big bucks. You should reach out to one of the company's customer service reps for pricing information.Reseller Web HostingIf you're looking to get into the web hosting business, but you don't want to deal with infrastructure matters, check out GoDaddy's reseller hosting packages. The company's two plans&mdash;the $8.99 per month Basic and the $14.99 per month Pro&mdash;offer sales and commission reports and credit card processing. The servers have the same RAM and storage amounts as those that Hostwinds supplies directly, which is not always the case.Unfortunately, GoDaddy's reseller packages don't come with email; you'd need to sign up for separate email plans for electronic mail. On the upside, GoDaddy lets you apply your own branding to the servers you rent, and it also supplies 24/7 tech support.Still, Hostwinds goes the extra mile with more generous specs in a variety of server categories. As a result, Hostwinds is the Editors' Choice for reseller hosting.Setting Up a GoDaddy-Hosted SiteGoDaddy's free website builder is called GoCentral. It's a completely responsive-design tool, which means you get a good-looking and functional mobile website alongside the desktop website you build. The drag-and-drop functionality makes page building a breeze. For $29.99 per month, you can add a capable web store.Email HostingOne of the better aspects of GoDaddy is that it is gradually abandoning its old cPanel email hosting service for accounts bundled with Microsoft Office 365 Business Premium, the Editors' Choice for email hosting. If you want to purchase email, here's the breakdown: Email Essentials (starting at $4.99 per month or $3.99 per month with a two- or three-year commitment) gives you 5GB of email storage. Online Essentials (starting at $9.99 per month or $7.99 per month with a two- or three-year commitment) ups the email capacity to 50GB and adds 1TB of cloud storage. Business Premium (starting at $14.99 per month or $9.99 per month with a two- or three-year commitment) raises the email storage capacity to 50GB and adds unlimited web conferencing and access to online Microsoft Word and Excel. Premium Security (starting at $24.97 per month or $14.99 per month with a two- or three-year commitment) tosses in encryption and Microsoft Office mobile applications.We found it a simple endeavor to set up our GoDaddy email, as the web host prompted us to create one during the sign-up process. We simply selected the domain to which the email address would be associated, and then entered an email handle and a password. In general, Microsoft Office 365 is fairly straightforward to configure, but GoDaddy has really taken the guesswork out.Since GoDaddy has essentially repackaged Microsoft Office 365, you get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of email features, both on the user side and from an administrator's perspective. Assuming you go with the Business Premium feature set as we did, you'll get the full Microsoft Office Suite along with its business collaboration tools. This means the usual productivity apps, such as Microsoft Access, Excel, Outlook, and Word, but it also gives you additional team collaboration, online conferencing, and even VoIP phone calling via Microsoft Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. However, we are a little disappointed in the pricing structure, as some of what GoDaddy sells as extra-cost add-ons, such as encryption, is already present if you go with a plan directly from Microsoft.Along with the slew of desktop apps, you also get access to Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), a sleek and modern web adaptation of the Outlook email client. It offers a familiar layout for calendars, contacts, and tasks, and a new ""focused inbox""&mdash;all available in your browser. What Microsoft means by a ""focused inbox"" is that, rather than just being a dumping ground for all incoming email, it defaults to a dynamic view that's constantly being updated. This tech is based on a machine learning (ML) algorithm that attempts to figure out which email is most important to you; everything else goes to the regular inbox. As you sort emails between the focused inbox and the regular inbox, the algorithm gradually gets better, helping you to concentrate on email that matters most. You'll also be able to use mentions. When creating a new email, if you prepend someone's name with the @ sign, then it will automatically Cc that individual. You can also apply a filter that will show you emails in which you were directly mentioned.We are pleasantly surprised to find that GoDaddy defaults to the same email management portal that admins would get by purchasing Office 365 directly from Microsoft. The one caveat is that some of the panes have been replaced with links back to the GoDaddy website. This applies particularly to user and license management. Many of the advanced configuration options remain intact, however. Because of this, you'll be able to take advantage of Exchange Online Protection for spam filtering, though you'll have to dig a little more to get to the Security and Compliance panel.E-CommerceGoDaddy has ditched its old Quick Shopping Cart e-commerce software in favor of the free GoDaddy Online Store. The new offering boasts many features, including secure checkout, SEO tools, store themes, and unlimited product listings.Setting up shop with the new tool is straightforward and easy. You select a theme, add products, pricing, and images, and pick your preferred payment and shipping methods. If you plan on using your website to sell products, GoDaddy Online Store is an excellent choice.Security FeaturesGoDaddy offers its own Website Security, a product that includes automatic malware scanning, continuous security monitoring, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Content Delivery Network (CDN). Website Security proactively blocks malware and malicious traffic from reaching your site. It also safeguards against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Zero Day attacks.You can also purchase Secure Sockets Layer certificates (starting at $69.99 per year), the software that's represented by a green padlock in your web browser when you visit, say, a financial institution's website. If you plan to sell products via your website, consider an SSL certificate an essential purchase, as it safeguards the data exchange between a customer and your servers.In terms of security for its hosted email services, you'll find this is all hosted in Microsoft's data centers. That means you'll have all the same security benefits as those provided to other Microsoft Office 365 users. Your email data will be encrypted in transit and at rest using SSL and Bitlocker technology. Per Microsoft's publicly available terms of service, Microsoft employees only have highly limited access to your data and only under specific, audited circumstances.But remember that while these specifications are nice, they only apply to data residing on GoDaddy's servers. In the case of email hosting, for example, users reading their email using a local email client, like Microsoft Outlook, will still be storing all that data on their on-premises devices where it won't be automatically encrypted. That means for full security, you should still invest in local data encryption software. And for those employees who access data from the road and remote locations, keep their data-in-transit safe by using a virtual private network (VPN) client.GoDaddy hasn't traditionally had an uptime policy for its older CPanel email. But since the company has transitioned to Microsoft Office 365 for its email services, it's now able to enjoy Microsoft's 99.9% uptime guarantee. However, be aware that GoDaddy has replaced the Office 365 health services dashboard with its own internally branded version. It shows the same kinds of information including when the last issue was, and whether or not it's been resolved.Strong UptimeWebsite uptime is one of the most important aspects of a hosting service. If your site is down, clients or customers will be unable to find you or access your products or services. You do not want that. Fortunately, GoDaddy was reasonably dependable in our tests.We use a website monitoring tool to track our test sites' uptime over a two-week period. Every 15 minutes, the tool pings our websites and sends an email if it is unable to contact any sites for at least one minute. The data revealed that our test site didn't go down once during the observation period. You can count on GoDaddy to act as a rock-solid hosting foundation.Decent Customer ServiceGoDaddy has 24/7 telephone support and live web chat support. We placed a call on a weekday morning and spoke to a customer service rep less than two minutes later. We asked about the different email tiers, and once again experienced the best customer support of any of the web hosting services we've tested so far. The rep was friendly and knowledgeable.A few hours later, we attempted to fire up GoDaddy's customer service web chat to ask an important question: How do we import our existing WordPress.com blog? Unfortunately, the web chat button was grayed out due to the reps being too busy. We had zero issues when we tried to chat again later that day.GoDaddy offers a 45-day money-back guarantee. That's lengthier than the standard 30-day refund window, but doesn't compete with DreamHost's generous 97-day money-back guarantee.Who's Your (Go) Daddy?GoDaddy has many business- and consumer-friendly options, a reliable Microsoft-based hosted email service, and quality 24/7 customer service. Note, however, that GoDaddy lacks cloud hosting plans, and has a skimpy number of default email accounts. Still, if you're looking to quickly set up a website, GoDaddy has the tools you'll need for a successful launch.For more on getting started online, read our tips on how to create a website.

GoDaddy have been totally amazing in providing me with help and assistance no matter what time I call. I highly recommend them.
They are just the best 
Blood suckers. I am a 5 year customer. Times are a bit tough right now. I have called in twice to renew my domain names and websites. When I told them I only wanted a &quot;month-to-month&quot; renewal the rep quickly became disinterested and tried his best to get me off the phone. I will not renew and will transfer all of my accounts. They seemed to have forgotten how they became a major player. 
??8?6????????????
Thanks for the great &amp; helpful service GoDaddy!
"Two weeks, 5 sites consistently down and Godaddy still ruins my life. One job lost, thousands of membership site clients unsubscribing and my partners wanting to kill me. This was not just one of the worst IT experiences I have had (after 8 years in the industry) but it was one of the worst experience of my life. Businesses lost, unimaginable stress and teams of workers sitting around for 2 weeks as they could not access the sites. In total I spent over 90 hours working on something that should be the most simple process ever - moving from one hosting to another. Wrong. To begin with they tell you to make a backup of your current hosting and upload it their server which can then unzip it and &#039;away you go&#039;. Well, it couldn&#039;t unzip it, 2.8GB is a super large file. So I had to download the file unzip, re upload the unzipped files and then the fun began. This is when wanting to kill myself and everyone at go daddy began. From a host of MySQL database errors, some they fixed, some they caused and all of which was &#039;outside of our current support&#039; but of course the sales staff say &#039;no worries we help guide you through all that&#039;. It&#039;s not simple with them, its not easy and they may even ask you to upgrade to a Cpanel system which means all your emails etc go back to the stone age. I hate you. Before that their 500MB of email space was only 500 accounts at 1mb each - bastards. There&#039;s another $100 given up for extra email space - not what sales tells you. Lies. The Music: What do you think would happen if they actually played depressing / not-upbeat music the whole time? People would be topping themselves. Finally I spoke to &#039;Phil&#039; - who, after spending an hour on the phone and helped me escalate my claim twice - one of my other sites on the server failed. FML . Thank god after a few biscuits and episodes of 24 they fixed what they broke. After now a total of $100 skype dollars of credit wasted they told me to begin it all again as they can&#039;t seem to fix the database for the primary domain or guide me on how to do it. Now, I do wish I was an American so I could go postal on their customer service department. Hear me guys - nothing, not even FREE hosting forever and ever is worth going with these guys. You know when you buy a ticket for a flight at a cheap price but after one piece of luggage and taxes the $60 flight is now $190? Well that&#039;s Godaddy on the web. So much has been lost in business, time and sanity with these guys. It took so long that my house-mate bet me he could learn all the countries in Africa before this problem was solved. http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/dec/20/geography-game-how-well-know-world He got it to 51/51. He beat me - and Bob Parsons I&#039;m gonna hire Jean Claude Van Dame from your stupid ads to come and sodomise you in the skull. I hate you go daddy. "

"Are the GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans a good choice for your website?



It's no surprise that GoDaddy offers plans tailored to the most popular content management system (CMS) on the web (WordPress!). Depending on your needs, the handy features that GoDaddy's WordPress plans provide could help your website succeed.





For our GoDaddy review for WordPress, we'll take a closer look at the features it offers, as well as its support system, performance, and prices. Let's get to it!











⚙️ Features



GoDaddy boasts a lot of variety when it comes to hosting. It provides shared plans, virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated options, and of course, WordPress-specific offerings.



Here's a full breakdown of the features you can access with the Basic WordPress hosting tier:



Free business email and domain for one yearDaily malware scans with SucuriAutomatic backups with one-click restoreSFTP access to your serverOut-of-the-box integration with a content delivery network (CDN)Automatic WordPress core updates



It's a decent feature set, although there's nothing here that's particularly unique compared to other hosts. 



The Ultimate plan serves up additional features including unlimited malware removal and hack repair, and one-click staging.



More impressively, the Ecommerce plan includes free access to premium WooCommerce features and extensions like WooCommerce Subscriptions. The premium extensions alone are worth thousands of dollars and offer serious value if you're creating a WooCommerce store.



📞 Support options and quality



GoDaddy's support quality is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, it offers 24/7 availability all throughout the year. However, the easiest way to contact a specialist is via phone.



Whether that's a pro or a con depends on your personal preferences. Other options include searching the GoDaddy Help articles, seeking assistance via the community forums, or – if you can find it – a live chat option tucked into the Product Support page:







You have to set your region as the United States in order for the live chat button to appear, which can be confusing for some users. This option is also only available from 5am–6pm Mountain Time, making it somewhat inconvenient for GoDaddy's international customers.



While support availability is generally good, the quality itself can be hit or miss. In our 2018 WordPress hosting survey of over 830 users, GoDaddy received the following scores for support (out of 5):



Overall support: 3.3WordPress-specific support: 3.3



While not horrible, it's below many other cheap WordPress hosts:



SiteGround: 4.7 (overall) / 4.5 (WordPress-specific)InMotion: 4.2 / 3.8DreamHost: 4.0 / 3.9A2 Hosting: 3.7 / 3.6Bluehost: 3.2 / 3.4



🏎️ Performance



Performance is a vital consideration when choosing a web hosting plan. Website optimization will only take you so far if your server is sub-par. For our GoDaddy review for WordPress, we took a look at all the speed-boosting features it offers, such as:



CDN integration. As we mentioned earlier, all of GoDaddy's WordPress plans provide out-of-the-box CDN integration for increased site speed.Load-balanced, clustered server environments. GoDaddy's servers are optimized for WordPress. Additionally, they're prepared to handle traffic spikes that might otherwise crash your site.99.9% uptime guarantee. GoDaddy provides an uptime guarantee in its contracts that enables customers to request account credits in the amount of 5% of their monthly bill if it fails to meet the minimum requirement. 



Like the features available in GoDaddy's Basic WordPress hosting plan, nothing here stands out as particularly unique or better than other providers. However, you can rest assured that you're at least receiving decent performance optimization.



Basic load testing with Load Impact



In a nutshell, traditional performance tests paint only half a picture. Even if you get stellar results after multiple consecutive runs, that doesn't tell you how your server will fare if it faces a sudden influx of traffic.



Recently, we compared several of the most popular WordPress hosting providers, including GoDaddy. We ran some pretty exhaustive performance tests for each host, including some load impact analyses.



For our stress test, we used Load Impact and had it simulate up to 40 concurrent users for our GoDaddy WordPress site. Here are the minimum and maximum response times from our results:



Minimum response time: 0.63 secondsMaximum response time: 0.83 seconds



Those are respectable numbers for any web hosting service. They're not the fastest we've seen, but the results are right up there. Overall, the performance to price ratio you get with GoDaddy WordPress hosting is not terrible.



Uptime with our hosting monitor



Having your site's server up and running is crucial. When it's down, you're missing out on ad revenue, email subscriptions, sales, and page views. GoDaddy guarantees 99.9% uptime, but our hosting uptime monitor shows a noticeable difference with GoDaddy frequently coming in below that mark.







While the difference between 99.9% and 99.1% uptime might not seem like a lot, that comes out to almost six hours of added downtime per month, which is substantial.



As a silver lining, you would be able to get a 5% discount if your site goes under the 99.9% uptime guarantee.



💰 GoDaddy WordPress hosting pricing



When it comes to WordPress, GoDaddy offers a managed service at some of the lowest prices on the market.



GoDaddy falls firmly under the category of budget WordPress hosting, with its most expensive plan coming in at just $15.99 per month:







Here's what you get with each plan, beyond the features we discussed before:



Basic ($6.99 per month): 1 website, 30 GB of storage, and up to 25K monthly visitors.Deluxe ($9.99 per month): 1 website, 75 GB of storage, and up to 100K monthly visitors.Ultimate ($12.99 per month): 1 website, unlimited storage and visitors, and a free SSL certificate.Ecommerce ($15.99 per month):  1 website, unlimited storage and visitors, and a free SSL certificate. 



Unfortunately, GoDaddy only supports a single website on every one of its basic WordPress hosting plans, which is a massive downside even at these prices. If you want to host multiple sites, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro plans, which start at a pricier $24.99 per month.



Another important factor to be aware of is that many of the features GoDaddy promotes in conjunction with its WordPress plans are available for free via plugins. Its daily malware scans are performed by Sucuri, its 'SEO Optimizer' is just Yoast, and WooCommerce provides unlimited products and no transaction fees out of the box.



On a positive note, GoDaddy does bundle a lot of premium WooCommerce add-ons with its top tier. These extensions are collectively worth thousands of dollars per year, so it's worth considering if you're starting an online store with WooCommerce.



As usual, to get the prices you see on the website, you need to sign up for a long-term contract. The fees mentioned above are available for a minimum of 36-months, which is pretty standard for budget hosts. For month-to-month payments, the Basic plan goes up to $12.99 per month.



Why not use GoDaddy's cheap shared plans?



Finally, it's worth mentioning GoDaddy's basic shared hosting plan is only one dollar cheaper than its managed WordPress counterpart. 



Additionally, excluding the lowest tier, all of GoDaddy's shared plans let you host unlimited websites, whereas the GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans limit you to a single website.



Those shared plans still let you install WordPress with a one-click installer, so why not use them?



Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with doing that. But the benefit of the WordPress-specific plans is that you get access to optimized WordPress performance, as well as beneficial features such as:



Automatic updatesStaging sitesMalware and hack removalBundled WooCommerce plugins



*The exact features depend on which plan you sign up for.



➕➖ Overall pros and cons



To close out our GoDaddy review for WordPress, here's a summary of its best features:



Prices are among the best for managed WordPress plans.You get access to an excellent list of features (especially for eCommerce).The performance is solid for the price.



On the other hand, the biggest downside to GoDaddy's WordPress plans, in our opinion, is that they only support a single website. If you want to host multiple sites, you'll need to look into its Pro Plans.



Beyond that, GoDaddy makes it difficult to find and use its live chat support option, which is not optimal. It's also important to mention for those who aren't experienced WordPress users that many of the features it lists are available for free with Sucuri, Yoast, and WooCommerce.



🏆  GoDaddy WordPress hosting review conclusion





Not too long ago, GoDaddy was synonymous with terrible performance and support.



However, lately, it's been putting a lot of effort into offering better services across the board.











In a nutshell, GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans offer adequate performance and a pretty attractive feature lineup, especially for online stores. However, we can only recommend it if you're looking to host a single website. Otherwise, you're better off looking elsewhere.

I was on chat and calls so many times. Our tech team was on it so many times. but there is always something else they tell you. Basically they block it in the backend stopping you from transferring your domain.  

This severely damaged our production time line because we couldn't make any changes during the process."
Very user friendly one of the original website builders. Now with multiple companies out there -some far too advanced for a novice...thank you Godaddy
Great and easy site!
"Very easy to purchase a registration in the beginning. However, I didn’t actually use the domain. I cancelled the renewal before its 2 year expiry, yet even weeks later keep getting harassing emails which assume I have forgotten to renew and warm in red that I will incur fees of $80 to recover what I don’t want. God forbid  there is someone who actually doesn’t need the domain name they registered any more. Reading other reviews it seems that my payment details expiring was the only reason I’m not having additional troubles. I really wish they would employ some intelligence in their cancellation process and subsequent emails so that the relationship remained on good terms. I doubt I will want to use them in the future if my needs change."
"Up until yesterday I was very happy with Go Daddy,

Had a really negative experience was left on hold for over 88 minutes still not answer, Went online & nobody answered my questions, I have a Cpanel issue & currently emails are not working & zero tech support.

"The help that I got from the migration experts at GoDaddy was excellent.  The folks that helped me, particularly Adam, were knowledgeable, helpful, available and helped me get things transferred over and up and running quickly and easily.  After transitioning e-mail, website and DNS registration from other vendors, I would make this choice all over again based on how well it worked and how easy the process was.  Cost was competitive for services received and a good value."
I’m just learning how to run my own website and I’m glad godaddy has a customer service line cause this isn’t very user friendly.  I’ve had to call multiple times since starting on the 7th of this month. But everyone I call has been super helpful.

"I called GoDaddy twice.  I waited on hold over 20 minutes both times.  Both times I was disconnected.  Last service reps were very rude, his name was Kevin.  I said 24 minutes to wait on hold is too long & he responded rudely.  I told him I already waited 20 minutes then he hung up on me - clearly intentional.  I will not be doing business with GoDaddy every again.  To wait on hold for this long with no answered question or resolution of any kind?  I never raised my voice or used inappropriate language.  Unacceptable."

"I was able to construct a website with assistance from Go Daddy techs in a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend using Go Daddy,"
excellent service :)
"Avoid at all costs. I have been purchasing domains and managing client hosting for 8 years now and GoDaddy are the worst company I have ever dealt with. Don't be fooled by ""cheap"" domains. They charge extra for almost everything, from whois protection to email which are often free with other companies. On top of that once you're in it's extremely difficult to disable auto-renewal due to ""extra security"" measures...domain locks, extra passwords, etc.  Also you can only request a refund by calling their Indian department where calls often drop. I have been trying to disable auto renewal but was uncuccessful because the admin panel kept giving me errors. I was of course charged. It's been impossible to get a refund. Please go with someone else and avoid this company."

the transfers. Everything by the book. However, without any explanations or reason, they are blocking the transfer of the domains.

g. Short version: servers of GoDaddy are NOT SECURED AND NOT PROTECTED, VERY OLD, NOT SECURED HARDWARE, which should be in the garbage! Nothing against Ddos attacks has been done. So all databases hosted on them got hacked, 28,000 clients have no access to their databases, not by php client, not by ftp, and many have their sites simply down!!!!
GoDaddy and ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group"" FELONY DISCLOSURE. Probably the feature POLICE case. Did you ever had this situation: you look for the domains for your company or for your client (and specially if you have a brand client with trademarks registered), and many times the domain is already taken, and GoDaddy propose you to pay 60$ to negotiate? Or you buy quiet expensive from ""private user"" domain in the auction? Yep, there's it is. And GoDaddy will never show who owns the domain of your client's brand. Many times you see this when you check for the owner in WHOIS other sources: ""Name Management Group, LLC (Nanci Nette), 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US"".
When you see this know that this ""Nanci Nette from Name Management Group"" is actually GoDaddy itself.
I'm going to lay down discovered facts. There's no such person as Nanci Nette, not a single social media profile. This so called ""Name Management Group, LLC"" simply doesn't exist in the California registry, and never existed (checked). And you can see the records of this Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC: this non-existing company owns about 45000 domains! And all of them only with GoDaddy!!! Address: 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US belongs to THE AVENUE - luxury apartments for rent. Yep!!!! All letters, including legal services (thousands of them) transferred to GoDaddy address, according to information provided by management of THE AVENUE.
And of course I strongly suggest you to Google ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" - you will see thousands lawsuits for ""domain squatting"". ""Domain squatting"" is ownership of the domains corresponding to brands names. For example I have company ""My Domain"", I own trademarks, I also have a domain ""mydomain.com"" and ""mydomain.net"", but I didn't purchase ""mydomain.org"" and ""mydomain.info"" or ""mydomain.co.uk"". Be sure that ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" / GoDaddy bought it and wants to sell them to you for very high price. And also check how all lawsuits are going. This ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" never responds to the complaint and judge orders to transfer the domain to the company who filed a complaint. GoDaddy does the transfer very quickly! Yep, all lawsuits go in this scenario! Little trick here though. Letting GoDaddy ""to negotiate"" the domain for you / or buying domain at the GoDaddy auction will be always less expensive than filing the lawsuit in WIPO or ICANN. Yep!!!!! GoDaddy FELONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"When I decided to redo my e-commerce, considering I was very happy with GoDaddy as a domain provider, I was confident to buy their bundle product of woocommerce/wordpress/hosting. It seemed a great deal for all they offered.
I took a couple of months trying to fix things and their support that was once great became an absolute nightmare.

I had conflicts with the woo plugins and when I approached woo, even though they were super helpful, they said they had no access as the subscriptions were all through GoDaddy, therefore they should provide me support. Godaddy would say they are not developers and the plugin problem should be handled by Woo. I went back and forth so many times and I can't say how frustrating it was. Also, the hosting is quite limited for settings, the website crashed a few times and was terribly slow. I optimized all I could but I was still not happy.

So, I finally contacted them to cancel my plan and work on a partial refund of some sort. Every person I talked to was like a repeating parrot going on and on about the refund policy being only for 30 days, and they were not web developers so they couldn't help me with the plugin problems.

I paid for a 3 year plan ($575.64) so I could get the best deal and they gave me zero options for a deal. I even suggested credit towards my domains. Nothing.
I am so so so frustrated with them and I really want everyone to know that I recommend NEVER hosting with them."
"A Convenient Host for Individuals and Starter Resellers
Despite a few kinks in its support and pricing, GoDaddy does provide an easy,painless website hosting experience.
GoDaddy is first and foremost a hosting provider that caters to those new to the hosting scene or who want a very simple hosting experience. That said, it does provide a few advanced features that will accommodate customers with more complex requirements. All of GoDaddy’s services and features are easy to purchase and set up; everything is accessible via an intuitive and clutter-free interface.
It’s not all good news, though. One of the most frequent complaints about GoDaddy is that it has tricky refund policies and that the platform has a lot of upsells. This means that you might end up paying extra for the convenience the platform offers.
So, whether GoDaddy is the right host for you or not, you’ll have to carefully read over the fine print &#8212; especially in terms of what you’ll end up paying long-term. If you do eventually decide to go with GoDaddy, then it’s definitely a very user-friendly and polished service.
Before you make a decision, we highly recommend you check out some alternative hosting companies, which we highly recommend.
Is GoDaddy Any Good? GoDaddy is a decent host if you don�t need a huge amount of resources or you�re just getting started with web hosting.
Do You Have to Use the GoDaddy Website Builder? No, GoDaddy offers regular shared hosting plans that you can use with apps like WordPress or Joomla.
Is Bluehost Better than GoDaddy? Both Bluehost and GoDaddy are budget shared hosting providers and both have their pros and cons. Make sure you read our full comparison review of Bluehost vs GoDaddy before you make your decision.
What Happens to Expired Domains on GoDaddy? When you allow a domain to expire with GoDaddy, you can recover it within 25 days. After this period, the domain will be listed for auction on GoDaddy Auctions.
Is GoDaddy Good for E-commerce? GoDaddy has some decent options for e-commerce, including an e-commerce plan which incorporates a website builder with online store features. You could also create a WordPress website and use WooCommerce to open an online store.

They won’t even speak to me unless I EMAIL them my drivers license, passport, etc. Not even a secure way to send this sensitive information and have NO idea who is receiving it on the other end. Just fed up with them. If you go with them after reading these reviews, can’t say you weren’t warned.

So tired of this site."

"they tell you that the whole ""team"" will work on your website, and really is one person who will slap it together in few hours if and they they will charge you for it pretty good."
"It took a longtime to  get help. I finally figured some stuff out after 5 days on my own.I finally went to publish my website ,I spoke to a rep finally, and he was able to help me publish but I had to pay for ayears subscription 12 days early so it would work. I felt scammed.Guess what i waited the perverbial hour,actually 4 hours and it still wouldn't work. I was able to get another rep and he got it to work but you couldn't google it like the public would you actually have to type it in the search bar ontop of the page. So what good is it if someone was to google mygreekrealtor.com and it it does not even appear.I just wasted,time,MONEY and my marketing strategy won't work. THIS SUCKS is my opinion."
"I have been a go daddy customer for 5 year + and this company doesn't value their customers AT ALL

I bought a domain privacy with them for 3 years. Whilst on a call with a GoDaddy rep I ""turned off""  privacy - Apparently to them this means cancel, after 5 mins when I try to turn the privacy back on, they tell me it has been cancelled and I would need to pay another 10 USD or so to get it back.

I tell this to the rep on the phone and she's trying to fix it, during which time the call gets cut. I called them up again (the have no email) give them my receipt number. They can see that I have already purchased this but refuse to turn it back on. I asked the new rep to stop reading his customer script to me and think about it logically, why should I pay twice? He says he doesn't need to be spoken to like that and he is going to terminate my call. REALLY???


I managed to get a customer complaint email address and have sent them a message, waiting for a reply. However if they ask me to pay twice for this, I'm probably moving to a competitor. Even ifs 1 USD, I refuse to pay for something twice"
"Wayne was very helpful and professional, he made my life much easier , im very grateful."
It’s hard to know what you are paying for or what options are. The website is confusing to navigate and I wonder sometimes if it is that way on purpose. I’m still using it however for my website for the time being.
"The price of extra email addresses for my domain are too expensive. 
I love my website, and themindfulguide.org domain."
I am loving GoDaddy. I’m not very techy when it comes to websites and designing but their site makes it so easy
Great experience creating my own site with the site builder.
"Dan listened to the problem I was having and set about solving it as if it were his own. Not only that, the phone was answered in under 1 minute. This is as good as service can get."
"I first bought the $98 deal, the basic I guess. Even after me saying to the person there that my intent was to publish a book. That takes more than 5MB and they should have known that. Instead I worked hours and hours on my website not knowing that what I needed really was the eCommerce version. One person there told me it has unlimited megabytes for books. I don't know yet if that is true or not. Can someone tell me the truth? Thanks. John Tetpon"
"It was a pleasure speaking to Wayne, he took time to explain to me the different services and offers available. I did not feel rushed and helped me find a previous domain name and explained how I can connect it up with Go Daddy. Fantastic service."
"STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM GO DADDY FOR BUILDING YOUR WEBSITE.-These people are scammers. I paid over $3000.00 for a new site
explained to them and even showed them what a wanted it to look like. What they built me was totally not what i wanted THE SITE WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!
Then it takes weeks to talk to anyone to try and get anywhere. 
They then said to me when I asked for my money back  ""  WELL WE BUILT YOU A SITE "" and we cannot give your money back. THIS TOOK 5 MONTHS. YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT EVEN IF YOU DON'T like the site.
WHAT A WASTE Of MY MONEY STAY FAR AWAY FROM GO DADDY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I have been using Godaddys brokerage service in pursuit of a particular domain. I had a small problem which I needed help with so rang the main number and found myself talking to Hannah. She was a delight to talk to, professional and luckily for me, patient. The problem was quickly resolved. Thank you, Hannah."
Excellent help and very understanding. Resolved my situation with ease and made the whole process comfortable.  Many thanks
"I did my website with godaddy because liked your site better than the others.
I do feel as if your just left to get on with it, I asked how I can rank in google search and was offered a SEO link at an extra cost of course. I don’t feel your site was over helpful during the website making stage, I thank you for the free time before I had to pay for the site, I have paid for the year now and am asked to give this review but during the making of my site herd nothing no hints or tips, I’m not good at such things and entering a market affected by Covid I’m thinking I should have waited a few months. So in short not overly happy about everything just ok. Time will tell and many more hrs looking at YouTube for advice."
"Really annoyed at the fact that they renewed a service with no warning, and have no online customer care - you *have* to call them - why not just send a pre-notification that a charge is coming due?  Because they are a money grabbing (and expensive) domain host that relies on users being stupid.  Well, I've just cancelled all renewals with them and will move my domains away from them - God help anyone who has built a website with them, as moving away would be even more difficult."
"I am loving the easy navigation and instruction with the site building, I am a 51 year old artist with no technical skills and now I'm addicted lol... ty go daddy to Helping in my own personal development and self pride ❤"
"Been using godaddy for 6years now. 
They made my first experience opening and continue to run a success online store! 

Thank You for your simplicity and all your help and advise godaddy!"
I've been extremely happy with GoDaddy as my Domain for my website.  Their prices are fair and a good option for my business.
"My tech guy, Ted, was awesome! He helped me maneuver through the process of updating my account and helped me get the best deal for the dollar. Loved him!"
"They slowed our site to try and sell a new $4,300 server sollution! We moved to AWS for $3.50 month. Site was not the cause of slow response. GD did it! 
If your site has a 20 second lag you are losing visitors!"
Good for domain and basic services like hosting. Customer service is good if you are lucky and get a US based agent.
"If you are after a quality service (with quality customer service), your best option is NameCheap. GoDaddy is outrageously bad at managing any customer issues. Their products simply do not work and they are always unwilling to provide you with a refund for non-working products.

They took the liberty to create a non-working email address for a domain that they don&#039;t manage (Unbelievable!). If the domain is not under their management it is impossible to have a working email address... Godaddy does not seem to understand that...

They also don&#039;t understand that, under the Fair Trade Act, they are obliged to address non-working products after their BS 30-day money back guarantee.

With NameCheap they keep your domain private for FREE and the domains and hosting plans are way cheaper than GoDaddy. They are super fast at responding to your requests and fix problems straight away. I am very glad that I&#039;ve found a great alternative to this shambles of a company."
"I enjoyed using Godaddy.  They use excellent support, especially if you are active in the process.

I understand prices are a little high.  Really do you homework.  Make sure you understand the difference between web hosting and site hosting, etc."
"There is no option in Godaddy&#039;s website to file a complaint which is the usual thing companies do to encourange communication and feedback between the company and their clients.

I have been using Godaddy for years and I feel totally cheated. Since users can&#039;t write nor chat to obtain support and users can just call, I have been &#039;helped&#039; by call agents. Those have given me wrong advise I see now that I have been paying as if I were a company with 25-30 websites when I just am a normal simple home user with one website.
I don&#039;t have much money but now I am stuck with paying 50 euros per month for services I have never and will never use. I have been totally cheated by Godaddy. I have never felt this way with anohter company. I have lost at last 2000 euros, but it feels worse. I feel I have ben cheated 2000 euros.

It seems the call agents work on commission and they have just sold me anything that was good for them and not for me. I insist, it&#039;s very hard for me to pay that money and I am not even using it. I am leaving Godaddy as soon as possible.

I want to ask a refund for having been mislead with information about hosting services I never needed.

It&#039;s very horrible that Godaddy behaves this way."
"The site is amazing ,the language is quite easy to read an navigate.Anyone would easily understand the language."
Godaddy made me buy the wrong product 3 times and they decline to refund me. every time I call or email them they tell me that they&#039;ll get back to me but they won&#039;t.
"You are still keeping your intellectual property - domains and sites assets with GoDaddy? YOU ARE DEAD!!!!!!!!!!! Run for your life if you still can!!!!
Here are the reasons. First of all they treat their clients like dirt. Having bunch of sweet sugar-candy youngsters to answer you on a phone is not a &quot;providing service&quot;. We left this company 7 months ago, after absolutely unspeakable incident - they blocked our web-site, known media source with 1 million readers... just because they can, and because I&#039;m an idiot - I made a decision to host our media with them in the first place. And now we live happily ever after with another hosting provider, very well, and secure, and specially me, as I&#039;m the one who&#039;s responsible for all web development in our company. We paid about 2000$ a year to GoDaddy. Who cares, right? GoDaddy happily participate in all unfair competition actions and felonies organized in USA, and block European commpanies during the time of the high sales. For the last 2 years GoDaddy lost millions of their clients, including shareholders. Check their stock....
Second of all - prices: GoDaddy make you feel that their services are cheap. Oh no!!!!! You actually pay very high price for domains - you can get them much cheaper with another provider and you don&#039;t need to be in their domain club - that&#039;s how they collect TVA taxes back if you are buying on behalf of the company and have your taxes reduced. Today for the same number of the domains and super hosting plans, private servers, protected against Ddos attacks, CDN etc (much higher than we had at GoDaddy) we pay alsmost hald price. In total we save about 500$ a year. 
So and the third reason - QUALITY!
GoDaddy propose to you all kind of hostings, private servers etc.... all of these are VERY OLD, NOT SECURED  HARDWARE, which should be in the garbage. Recently May 4th, 2020 sites, 28,000 hosted with GoDaddy sites GOT HACKED!!!!!!!! Wordfence developers (known security plugin) received this information and publicly announced it. Details see on their blog. Short version: servers of GoDaddy are NOT SECURED AND NOT PROTECTED! Nothing against Ddos attacks has been done. I remember how many times our web-site was down because of that when we hosted it with GoDaddy. Our company had massive financial damages...... GoDaddy selling you place on very old server, no security, no nothing, nada, for very high price. So all databases hosted on them got hacked, 28,000 clients have no access to their databases, not by php client, not by ftp, and many have their sites simply down!!!! Congratulations!!!!!! There you go, GoDaddy, results are very well deserved!!!!! I personally glad they got it, and I also hope that poor clients who got hacked will file massive lawsuit against GoDaddy, and demand financial damages for their hacked web-sites.
And!!!!!! GoDaddy and &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group&quot; FELONY DISCLOSURE. Probably the feature POLICE case. Did you ever had this situation: you look for the domains for your company or for your client (and specially if you have a brand client with trademarks registered), and many times the domain is already taken, and GoDaddy propose you to pay 60$ to negotiate? Or you buy quiet expensive from &quot;private user&quot; domain in the auction? Yep, there&#039;s it is. And GoDaddy will never show who owns the domain of your client&#039;s brand. Many times you see this when you check for the owner in WHOIS other sources: &quot;Name Management Group, LLC (Nanci Nette), 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US&quot;. 
When you see this know that this &quot;Nanci Nette from Name Management Group&quot; is actually GoDaddy itself. 
I&#039;m going to lay down discovered facts. There&#039;s no such person as Nanci Nette, not a single social media profile. This so called &quot;Name Management Group, LLC&quot; simply doesn&#039;t exist in the California registry, and never existed (checked). And you can see the records of this Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC: this non-existing company owns about 45000 domains! And all of them only with GoDaddy!!! Address: 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US belongs to THE AVENUE - luxury apartments for rent. Yep!!!! All letters, including legal services (thousands of them) transferred to GoDaddy address, according to information provided by management of THE AVENUE. 
And of course I strongly suggest you to Google &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; - you will see thousands lawsuits for &quot;domain squatting&quot;. &quot;Domain squatting&quot; is ownership of the domains corresponding to brands names. For example I have company &quot;My Domain&quot;, I own trademarks, I also have a domain &quot;mydomain.com&quot; and &quot;mydomain.net&quot;, but I didn&#039;t purchase &quot;mydomain.org&quot; and &quot;mydomain.info&quot; or &quot;mydomain.co.uk&quot;. Be sure that &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; / GoDaddy bought it and wants to sell them to you for very high price. And also check how all lawsuits are going. This &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; never responds to the complaint and judge orders to transfer the domain to the company who filed a complaint. GoDaddy does the transfer very quickly! Yep, all lawsuits go in this scenario! Little trick here though. Letting GoDaddy &quot;to negotiate&quot; the domain for you / or buying domain at the GoDaddy auction will be always less expensive than filing the lawsuit in WIPO or ICANN. Yep!!!!! GoDaddy FELONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"If there was a zero star, I would allocate this!!!! Started to deal with GoDaddy in early 2009 when I had an online company and found their front line support team were AMAZING, HELPFUL, POLITE &amp; RESPECTFUL. But that&#039;s where it ends, I have just wasted 15 hours on the phone to them, on 3 occasions a supervisor was supposed to call me and NEVER called - I finally sat on hold today for an hour waiting and actually spoke to a Floor Supervisor called Marcos, so they are actually real!!! Only to be told, too bad, it&#039;s your problem, we can&#039;t help you - regardless that it was the GoDaddy staff who created the problem..... cannot believe a company can treat a customer of 11 years like this.

I purchased my domain name for email purposes in August 2014 through GoDaddy and this all ran through my Personal Microsoft account which has my Microsoft Office 365 subscription. Through my Outlook app I ran both my personal email and business email.

In August 2018 I received my GoDaddy Domain renewal and the costs were 2.5 times more expensive than when I had set up the whole thing with them in 2014. I called the support crew and spoke with someone there and asked why were the costs so high? He stated he could put me on a cheaper program which was email only (as I didn&#039;t need an actual website) however it would mean I may lose some data. I told I needed to keep the costs as low as possible so we went ahead  at no time did he mention he would need to create a 2nd Microsoft Account and have it listed as a Business Plan Account.

In early March 2020 I had issues of my Outlook always asking for my email password and I called their centre at least 4 times and reset the password, tried security on the account nothing stopped the password locking  they advised me there was another device trying to log in with an old password. This could not be as I had signed out of my old devices and did a factory reset before disposing of them.

Last Sunday March 22, 2020 we finally worked out that I had 2 Microsoft accounts .... I was then advised that the business Online Plan 1 Account did not allow for me to use the Outlook app as it was not included in the subscription. They then advised I needed to speak with Microsoft and request for the two accounts to be merged .... see via separate email a copy of the log from when I contacted Microsoft who explained me the situation that the two accounts are on different servers and could not be merged but maybe Outlook.com could offer me a solution. I REALLY do not want to change my email address again and I need the data from my Exchange account such as emails, contacts, calendar etc.

GoDaddy have basically thrown me under the bus, I am now stuck with having to do the following:
Run my Work Email with no contacts or calendar through the Office 365 Outlook app AND my personal exchange email account through the standard windows 10 Mail app for PC which contains all of my personal &amp; work contacts plus my calendar, again personal &amp; work all in one place"
"Customer Support is excellent!
Amazing experience using their services for the first time. 
5 stars FOR SURE!"
"Do Not go to go daddy they have continued to charge my credit card for three months after i canceled.
If you talk to Julian&lt; who is supposed  to be in charge of cancellations, Do not belive a word he SAYS!!!!,
STAY AWAY FROM GO DADDY"

"I&#039;ve been a Godaddy customer for over a decade. Recently, the company has been changing fast and adopting certain predatory behaviors. On November the 4th, 2019, I received a notice that my domain expired on October the 31st because of an &quot;invalid or expired credit card&quot;. That was a surprise since all my other domains were being auto-renewed regularly. Also, I received no notice about any attempt to charge said invalid payment method. I checked my account and indeed, the Capital One card that was subject to leak by the company and exposed me to fraud and theft was there. However, there were three other payment methods (debit and credit cards), all valid. There is a reason a customer provides several payment methods when the company allows (and encourages) this: when something happens to one, the company charges the next. That&#039;s not what Godaddy did: they cancelled my domain but they offered to retrieve it from the &quot;parked nameservers&quot; for a $80 fee. In my understanding, this is extorsion. Apparently, they agree with me (that this is an illegal practice) since I called them the following day, I was very clear that they would be reported in case they refused to fix the situation and indeed they fixed it immediately. On November 10, 2019, again I received an email from Godaddy about an expired product due to &quot;invalid or expired payment method&quot;. Now they have no reason to claim that since I deleted all the other cards, leaving only my one very valid debit card on file. This is another attempt from Godaddy to inflict small damages, with small irregularities that their customer service agents are completely unsuccessful in fixing. The last one dropped the line (accidentally?) and the next one came asking for the same information. Keeping me all that time online creates a debt from Godaddy to me. I will bill them for that because there are too many red flags that this was a malicious action. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#039;t. Let Godaddy choose which it is: if they pay, showing willingness to meet their damaged customers half-way, then they look good. Otherwise, they strengthen my hypothesis."
"They sound inexpensive at first. They are not! they are ridiculously expensive. Just wait for an auto-renewal, they will sneak in a nice price hike &quot;after your promotion ended&quot;.

Terrible business model!

They charged me an &quot;auto-renewal&quot;, and since I wasn&#039;t expecting it, I didn&#039;t check my business credit card account. I found out when I got the late fee notification by mail from the credit card company.

At times like this, that amazon AWS charges cents for hosting ... this guys at GoDaddy auto-charged me over $600 dollars for &quot;shared hosting&quot; (your site in the same server along with hundred others competing for resources)

Called customer service. They just made me laugh: 
- they couldn&#039;t refund me because 30 days had passed. Of course! I didn&#039;t know they had charged me.
- the rep: named Landon (didn&#039;t want to provide last name) literally said: since you already (forcibly) paid for it, you might as well use it.

Just save yourself some headache. Stay away from this clown business."
"Provides good attention to the user.
It has easy payment plans and no commission
although I think they should put a chance to acquire it for free"
"Go daddy SEO services is a total scam . I have called in and canceled my service the 2nd day , spoke with a manager and said i will get my refund in few days , a week later no emails and they apparently working on the website. They are the worst ....never pay upfront for their seo service. they are horrible !!!!!"
"Don&#039;t even search for a domain on here, they use a an algorithm to monitor for good ideas and then immediately register them under godaddys name to charge..."
"What a rip off!  Totally screwed by GoDaddy.  Paid for their service and have been mislead, misinformed, and flat out lied to by customer service.  After a month of being jerked around I asked today&#039;s supervisor named Caleb who I could speak with to lodge a complaint with and he said, no one.  I asked him how he was gong to handle the misinformation I previously received, he sent me an email on a totally unrelated subject.  GoDaddy just plain sucks"
"Terrible customer service, they parked my domain after I used its search engine and then proceeded to try and make me pay over 100 to get it back. Do not use its search engine or else they will buy your domain."
"no point talking to the trashy salesman. the bean counters see a buck and go for it. ok I was a week overdue and they nailed and sold my domain name that I had held on to for 20 years.
they are scum."
I purchased a way cheaper business email address & web domain than what other companies offered. Happy with everything besides the fact that I have to log into Outlook and THEN Godaddy to access my emails. I hope there is an update soon where I can log in directly rather than double handling.
Spoke to 4 useless customer service people in a row. Spent over 2 hours on phone to them. The domain i owned and wanted to transfer was cancelled by one of those guys in the frustration of the calls even though i had renewal until 2021. They kept saying i did it. Hopeless. So much fluff. Frustrated as helL!
"Spent over an hour and a half online with an operator who had no idea what he/she was talking about. I asked for an email address that I could lodge a complaint with. Guess what..... no email address is available.
As soon as I figure out how to dump Godaddy and retain my email address and domain name I'll be changing.
Good grief. I've just read other reviews. I thought I might have been alone. This mob sound like they need to be investigated."
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS EVEN FOR DOMAINS. Their control panel is painfully awkward to navigate, their support will leave you running around in circles for hours..."
"They are the worst company I have dealt with, all they do is try to upsell you on stuff you don't need. They also say they want to help but never do.

My issue is that they charged me $240+ for an SSL certificate when they are advertising them at $14.95. When did I call them saying why are you advertising at this price but charging me so much? They stated 'it was a fake ad and the link won't direct me to the Go Daddy website and that they have NEVER done prices like this. Clearly I was speaking to a Trump supporter, so god only knows their leve... Read more

l of intelligence. WRONG! No apology either at this point. I then ask what can you do for me price-wise, I am happy to pay more but 7 times more is a joke, look after me as a customer. They said we can cancel the SSL and you can do this by yourself. Your website will go down until you reissue the SSL, we WON'T help you if you get stuck. Seriously? I am paying for a product! You need to provide it. They must love the Ferengi and the Rules of acquisition 'Once you have their money... you never give it back.' Because this is the vibe I get whenever I deal with them. Stay away. Once my good friend who is in IT able to I am changing everything away. They don't care about customer retention even though it takes more money to get a new one than it does to keep one. Learn some good business Go Daddy!"
"The sale person misled me to think $417 webhosting renewal include SSL Certificate, I am not happy with Sale misled me that to believe the Hosting total $417 included the SSL price, instead of extra $337.93 on top of hosting renewal become total $754.93
however, I only found out when credit card statements, He deducted an extra $337.93 on top of $417, makes the total bill $754.93
When I want to complaint, the supervisor to me to go to US legal dept, NOT in Australia base."
"https://letsencrypt.org has been providing free SSL certificates for years, yet GoDaddy tries to charge $109.99 a year, trying to scam non-technical people. I have never requested anything to ""auto-renew"". Oh also I can't disable it because their website has technical issues. Avoid at all cost, I just moved everything away from those scammers."
"My domain registration lapsed as the email from GoDaddy to renew went to my junk folder.
Now, because I wanted to keep everything with another provider - I deactivated my domain name under godaddy's account page.
Well - little did I know that they were going to hold it active in their name - on the icann database - so that I'd have to pay them an extra $80usd redemption fee to release it!!!!
Really appalling tactics..."
I have never experienced incompetence of this kind with any other business. It has taken over 2 weeks and 9 engagements with customer service staff simply to get domain updated.
"And guess what, not one supervisor will speak with me or any of their management - clearly, whilst their teams are super friendly and eager to help, supervisors and management don't practice what they preach ... these poor team members have no backup and there is NOWHERE you can make a complaint - their website states a supervisor
DON'T go there ... one of their team created a 2nd Microsoft account without my knowledge and my exchange email with them runs thru this account - however, my Office 365 subscription is with my personal Microsoft a... Read more

ccount and the 2 accounts CANNOT be combined ... nearly 14 hrs @ $60 per hour which is my hourly contractor rate, so far have lost $840 is productivity time to be on the phone (lucky I'm working from home right, as that's almost 2 full days) of sitting on the phone and the outcome, you ask? Now waiting for my 3rd supervisor / manager to call me and fix up the mess one of their staff members created .... fingers crossed ..."
"Domain Alliance, a search engine optimisation (seo) service, contacted me to promote their service three days after I built up my website through GoDaddy. I have paid them since they know all the details of my website, including my name, so I think they must know it from GoDaddy. However, I could not see any progress after paying the money.
I have been contacting them for refund, but of course no response.
I have contacted GoDaddy on the livechat, contentcomplaints@godaddy.com,
and udrpdisputes@godaddy.com. They kick the issue to each other and nobody gives a try to resolve it.
Now I have a big doubt on the quality of GoDaddy's customer service too. I won't renew the website with GoDaddy again."
Never again...scabs wouldn't refund my money even after I upgraded after speaking to them and taking their advise and it was still crap... would never recommend anyone to use them
Mum has had a website hosted by Go Daddy for the past 5 years. This week she received a renewal & they tried to put up the price she had originally paid by 500%. She managed to negotiate the price down. The call centre operator from Go Daddy advised because her site was 5 years old her website would need to move from an old platform to a new platform but that if she made payment it was a quick job & he would do it for her. She made payment then he never returned her call & other call centre operators she has since spoke with have told her sorry this would not be possible & she would need to rebuild her website from scratch. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
"Godaddy not only deserves NO STARS but it deserves investigating. It has the dodgiest business practices. After an enquiry into the banking industry, web services could be next. It's full of charletons and shysters and GoDaddy are one of the worst. Their business model is built around confusion, fear and dishonesty. After having been tricked into getting their WebBuilder+eCommerce package I discovered it had very little capability and wouldn't do what I wanted. The demo video had been carefully constructed to gloss over the inabilities.
So, I ... Read more

was left with cPanel hosting. The SSL installation process was an absolute nightmare: complex, convoluted and no support. When I go through the Chat help, it involves over an hour of explaining at length what the problem is (with people who don't really understand English, and don't even try to suggest that's racist, because I have no idea what race they are. I only know that they don't (or pretend not to) understand English. They could be Australian for all I know.) The ""advice"" I have received from GoDaddy has been inconsistent (even between Customer Reps), and in most cases, just plain wrong. Most times I have worked out the issue for myself, using google search and logic. The customer service reps aren't listening to the problem, they're looking for a way to sell you something else. I feel for them, I really do, I'm sure that not EVERYONE at GoDaddy is trying to rip people off. Most people try to do the right thing but I'm sure the GoDaddy business model doesn't accommodate that. The management team at GoDaddy should be ashamed of themselves. I would think that for all their trickery and immoral efforts at pinching that extra buck out your pocket, they would be far better off having a sensible business model, backed by authentic customer service and building trust with the customer. The customer would GLADLY buy services from a company that can be trusted and that offers real support. GoDaddy is NOT that company. Go elsewhere."
GoDaddy are my go-to for domains as a developer. Amazing customer service over the phone and just bloody easy to work with. Been mucked around by other providers for domains but never had an issue with GoDaddy.
"So a year ago I used their service for a couple months. I now no longer have an account with them no longer use their service but they still took $25 from me, charging me for another year and yet I no longer have an account or website with them. I cant even get my money back, such crap."

"Paid Godaddy for two year non recurring contract. After two years they billed my credit card for a new two year contract but I had NEVER agreed to extending. They even sent me emails to renew contract and I never did. They billed me and then refused to return the money to my credit card company.
  GODADDY STOLE $824.96 from me by billing my credit card without a new contract to renew. It was not an automatic renewal. They even refused to credit the credit card company. To be honest and not a thief like godaddy I payed my credit card never to get reimbursed for my loses. Be very wary of this company.  Thieves."

"So far I have had a really smooth and easy experience with GoDaddy.

I lost the contents in 'subfolder B' and I ended up having fixed the links to over 1000 images. DO NOT trust their content migration service."
They allow people to join that make out there a huge company when in fact there one person. They allow there users to steal policy’s from other users. They allow domains to put up threats to customers. They allow users that don’t even own a company to make out there huge. When in fact there nothing .You waist your time making reports. As nothing gets done as promised
Pathetic service. They charged the CC as soon as you check-out but never received any email with instructions on installations. Their staff are very dodgy on the Chat Session. They just vanish without resolving the issue particularly the girl Lakshmi Soumya

Now no one is responding to my enquiries and I still do not have a refund. I have spent more time now on this issue than the refund is worth and am very disappointed with their service! My advice is to steer clear"
"We signed a three year deal with Godaddy for web hosting which included hosting the website and email. After two years into the deal, they have contacted us and said they no linger wish to provide this sort of email service and are cancelling it. We are now required to pay them for access to our email. The base level of email service is around 50% of the original hosting cost. Do not believe that this company will honour their contracts."
"What a blatant rip-off. They change things around and then add extra costs onto unwanted rubbish. AVOID THESE SCAMMERS!!!!! Just doing the basics is a nightmare. Bad, bad, bad, BAD!!!!"
"I wanted to change Godaddy to do my hosting and they promised they will guide me through the whole process but they let me down.
They sent me articles which were incorrect,I called them and they admitted to that and then they said to me now you need to do the second part of transfer of your file by yourself and this part is more difficult.The lady I spoke to was very rude so they sent me another instructions to do everything by myself.Before I paid my subscription they promised they will help me and basically now they wished me good luck.
Well Godaddy very horrible customer service experience!!!! You should be ashamed of it!!! I am very disappointed!!!"
Never go with Godaddy. They increase prices year by year. If you forgot to renew your domain or hosting it is a fortune for them. It starts from $250.00 onwards. Don't rely on them. keep a backup always. Better find another company for a piece of mind.
"Godaddy is a horrible choice for Australians planning to host their website. Here are some points on why they're bad:
-Clunky and slow interfaces, outdated technologies, frustratingly bad menu system: it's filled with menus on top of menus, the design could be so much simpler.
-Their nearest data center is in ASIA, meaning if you host with them your website is significantly SLOWER compared to an Australian hosted web service.
-Downright horrible service
-Outdated documentation, making troubleshooting issues using their documentation much harder
-Restrictive email relaying system
-SSL system filled with bugs and issues"
"I lost weight sweating bullets with the poor hosting experience I had with Go Daddy.

ce delivery and never from companies as big as GD. I honestly believed the bigger was the better approach and boy was I wrong. I lost an entire week dealing with GD instead of dealing with my clients and with my main business site down because of simple SSL issues Ilost God knows how much revenue. I didn't mind paying the money if I received the service and promptly but this was nowhere near the case with GD. I moved my sites away from GD cause I just gave up dealing with them and from 800 plus dollars with GD, I paid 150 with another company for three sites and with free SSL and the sites were migrated over in less than a day, not nearly a week as it was with GD. They may be ok with domain registrations but I would never recommend hosting with these guys. Like the title says..Save your money and avoid the headaches"
"We lost out whole website due to their consultant incompetence. We have prolonged the expiring hosting Cpanel over the phone but the representative forgot/didnt do it right. Therefore, the services were canceleed and we lost the whole websote. Wanted to charge us 250 dollars for restoration even though it was their fault."
"I was called by one of the go daddy sales team telling me that the domains they were hosting for me were on old technology and needed to be upgraded. I was travelling loads at the time for work and agreed to the upgrade. The so called upgrade was very misleading as what they did was provide microsoft office 365 licences to all my family that we didnt need, didnt know we had nor did we use it. The bill came to $1400, it was charged to my Amex card and when i picked it up a few weeks later they refused to refund it. Ive sinced moved everything to Dream host and couldnt be happier (for a fraction of the cost)"
These guys are so shonky. I cancelled my plan which had 2 weeks left until renewal. Straight after cancellation they denied me access to the FTP and I could not transfer files. Said I had to pay a an extra $150 to get data back.
"SSL was meant auto renew in October, was charged 2 months prior to the date. Had to cancel my service to get refund, lost 2 months of my prepaid service."
"I received a call from a salesman. Telling me that as my web server was not secure I should pay up to roll over onto a secure server.

This would be ok IF I didn’t have another 14 months on my current contract (paid up as a 5 year plan). PLUS the guy on the phone made me feel as if I didn’t take up the offer the cost would escalate next year. Ever felt like you’ve got a gun to your head GoDaddy?? Essentially they wanted me to pay up $450 now to “secure” my price and roll over early - thus they secure my business for another 5 years!

I was so concerned about my hosting tonight that I rang customer service to see if I could gain further clarification. Thank God the person I spoke to put my mind at ease and emphasised that I was under no obligation or pressure to take this offer - however, it was stressed to me that my current server was like an “old car”. Does this mean they sold me a sub standard product 5 years ago?? This sales tactic is LOW. I am a small business with limited means. When I paid my 5 years in good faith I did not expect to receive a hard sales pitch 14 months out from the end of my time."
I have tried 15 times to get godaddy to fus my SSL issues. Why am I paying them over $600 a year for services and $300 for SSL. So incompetent
"I received a call from Godaddy saying that I needed to change hostings within their company because the old version was going to e deleted, which then I agreed to pay for the new hosting and requested for the old one to be removed, nevertheless, they never removed the old hosting and instead charged as their product is setup to have auto renewals. In addition, I was charged for an autorenewal for an email product that was given me for free and I was never informed about that product.

Be very aware of what they really sell you."

Thanks for making it so easy :)
Super smooth experience; I had a product code and wanted to ensure I received everything included.  After having some trouble with ordering on the site I reached out to a sales agent and they got me setup painlessly!
GoDaddy provides a very user friendly web building experience.
"Twice I have used go daddy and their greatest quality is that it is so easy to talk to a human being and not a machine, and that kept me coming back, great communication."
I am very pleased. We started out a little bumpy but GoDaddy addressed the issues they were having and things are working perfectly.
The pre-formated website that I chose is perfect for my business and easy to use.
"Good service, I want to know if a certain service can be booked at different times that another service. Other than that, easy set up."
Easy modern and cheap
"Stuart Has helped me to setup my mail and office365 environment in no time, while having a relaxed conversation. Great service."
"I have been a GoDaddy customer for quite a few years now.  I am quite happy with their service, but there are some things that are annoying at times with them. 

The biggest one is not disclosing everything that is going on.  Especially in regards to new orders.  Recently I purchased an Office 365 Business Premium subscription from them.  I was sent an email saying everything was set up and ready to go.  The only problem was that it was not ready to go yet.

For the most part my subscription was ready to go except for OneDrive.  I spent a frustrating night trying to get it working with no success.  It was final ready in the morning.  But it would be nice to be told that upfront instead of thinking that it was something on my end that was keeping OneDrive from working.

Also their help pages could be more technical in nature.  Often times the help pages are very basic.  With all the settings that there at times, having a help page that just tells you the very basic detail leaves you wondering what these settings do.  Often times the only way to know is to try and learn from experience.

The upside to GoDaddy is their reliability.  In all of the years of using them for my domains and hosting, I have never had a problem with my sites going down.  Which is one of the reasons I do stay with them despite the other problems."
I received a charge of €50 from this company which I have never used. I got onto their customer service over a month ago. A representative named Ivelin assured me it would take 3 days to be refunded. I have not heard from him in over a month. I rang their customer care and I waited for 30 minutes trying to get through to a representative which cost a further €20. and still no answer. I am furious. This company has cost me €70 and I have never used their services.
Love Go Daddy all my accounts are with GD thanks for being so efficient.
"Limited web templates, very very struggling to update my website. I have to clear all my history browse every time when i want to access and manage my website. Sometimes, it even doesn't work."
The only good for domain names.. hosting is not their core.
"Pros:
• good service
Cons:
• none"
Not a bad place if you want basic hosting. It is relatively reliable and the support is (eventually) there. Also it is an old player in the field and unlikely to close up shop any time soon.

ed hosting, the second website has been down for over 24 hours. Support is quite normal, though, in the first case I managed solve the problem myself, and in the second case they were trying to be helpful, though I was speaking to customer support not the technical people who were actually working on the problem. GoDaddy has recently introduces a quite useful Worldpress hosting package, which works well. But they have been often twicking it, which was causing some delays and off times, though not quite often. In overall I recommend GoDaddy, although if reliability factor is crucial for your website you might want to look somewhere else.

I used Go Daddy for domain registration and email hosting because they were cheap. I had a great experience with godaddy . They refunded a fee with no hastles at all
"Dear Go Daddy thank you so much for your Monday motivation. And absolutely, the journey must first begin, only thing is your service is a complete contradiction to the marketing messages you are “selling” to the hard working business owners and consumers here in Australia.
Well because you asked what steps we took to turn our entrepreneurial idea into reality we thought it was only fair to answer - here we go:
We have spent over one thousand hours and we have spent over $6,000 dollars to not even complete one step with Go Daddy.
Our small but ... Read more

awesome business sought out your services over 4 months ago as we were expanding ( yay this is meant to be something to celebrate) and wow what a humble beginning you have offered us. Where does one begin when they have so many encounters? Ok well, let’s see we migrated our account across, couldn’t send emails for about 1 month, had our account hacked despite us having Azure set up and 2 point authentication - We were advised by one of your team members not to worry its just malware! ( oh ok Malware bots are so friendly said no-one ever) After several fruitless hours/ calls to your dedicated support team, we finally made an inroad and it was admitted to us that the issues were experiencing were due to the fact that the security had been removed by one of your team members, who was just so excited to sell us the latest Wordpress package, and they believed in the product so much that they felt it was ok to completely compromise their customers accounts to make a sale. ( are you serious ) Your staff must be on KPIs as this is just B/S. We then escalated this to Microsoft premium 365 who will be in touch with you soon due to your mismanagement. We have had to make daily calls that went for at least 1 hour and some days there were several. To the point, we lost 2 jobs due to we couldn’t quote/go to meetings as we were in damage control mode dealing with your lack of dealing. Our CPanel ( which we only moved due to the great advice of your caring and helpful staff stating it would streamline our business and cope with the number of sites we build) We were also advised to do so as your server was so slow to load it was taking twice the time to run our business. Well, anyway the CPANEL was also hacked by malware bots and there goes 6 months of work! There was no support from your team or even the slightest genuine motivation to help remedy this. And Go, Daddy, If you send me a message ill give you our account number and you will see the hours and hours of calls notes blah blah blah."
Just purchase an SSL certificate and my website is not hosted with go daddy they cannot help me install it and it has been over 30 days so they won't refund BUT when I purchase it DID NOT said anything about that! Very poor consumer service.
"Sold me a hosting package that was incompatible with the platform i was using, then locked me out of cpanel, for two months rendering it useless, had to move to another provider costing thousands due to being locked out, finally got moved over then then godaddy said they would not refund me any of the money I paid for hosting I can not use."
"We have a WordPress website that is hosted with GoDaddy Managed Wordpress service. In our plan, we have an allowance for two websites. each website has a staging website.
The plan was to use one website as dev\test and the other one as a staging production. so we will do dev -> test -> staging - > prod. and we were happy to buy the managed WordPress plan because we didn't want all the headache around the WordPress admin. BUT THE SAD REALITY IS:
1. I will start with the interaction with them:
a. Every time you call Godday you are expected to s... Read more

pend at least 17 - 30 minutes until someone picks up the phone. b. every time speak with someone, you need to tell your story again and again - they seem to ignore all the notes that other tiers noted, even if it was in the same conversation. c. they don't return call you back if the call disconnected and you need to call again (it's a bit frustrating when on the phone with them 60 min - 90 min) and obviously you need to wait again, tell the story again and so on... 2. You can't push from one website to another website - that means we need to do the development, testing and staging on the staging web site. 3. The admin doesn't allow you to restore the staging website from backup, that means any issue in the development you need to call them and this is painful (Point #1) 4. Pushing the Staging to the production in our case failed, so we had to have manually pushed by the backend team, this had to be done 5 times and every time they say the process can take up to 1 hour so if you still have an issue then call us again (point #1-5 again). 5. during the attempts to push manually the Staging to the production they screwed the staging also, so for two days we didn't know what is going with all our work."
"Wow - didn't think this could happen, paid for everything spent a heap of time getting my domain, building my website, paying for additional emails, setting them up THEN get an automated response saying to prove my credit card is mine. Uploaded my license which has my abbreviated name i.e. Chris vs Christos. They cancelled my site Did not respond to my emails only via automated agents. Lost my domain, lost my email, lost my images, lost all my work and not even a hint of support."
"Getting started with Godaddy was very easy and quite inexpensive. But over the following year as the introductory period ended it became quite expensive. When I tried to cut back on some of my products my attempts were reversed on their web site. After much frustrating discussion with their Support team I was convinced that I had to set up Two-Step Verification so I could securely cancel my products and stop the auto renew charges. I did that and cancelled all my auto-renewals. During the past month I have been inundated with emails about my au... Read more

to-renewals because somehow one of them has been turned back on. To turn it off I have to log in using the Two-Step Verification but the phone number for the 2nd step code has been changed to one that isn't mine. So I can't log in and their Support team say they can't either. They require me to email them a copy of photo ID with my face clearly shown, my signature, date of birth and so on before they will assist me. This is a huge security risk from a company who can't prevent my phone number from being changed on my ""secure"" account and I won't do it. So they intend to continue auto-renewing my account indefinitely. The only way to prevent them is to cancel my credit card. What a hassle!!"
"I rang up to renew my domain name and it was canceled by the Consultant.

Then I was sold an SSL Certificate and NOT TOLD at time of purchase that I needed to get a Web Developer to code it onto my website. Therefore, I have paid for something that has been of ABSOLUTELY NO USE to me!

The Consultants are paid an incentive to sell you additional products and services. They induce you to buy products, without giving you all of the information you need in order to gain benefit from what you have purchased.

In other words my experience has been that they apply deceptive conduct to induce the purchase of products/services."
"I have now finally cancelled all my Hosting services and SSL certificates on GoDaddy. I am running 2 VPS servers on Linode for the same cost ($25/month paid by the hour) as my one GoDaddy shared hosting! (I have not looked back - to get the same VPS on Godaddy would cost $41.98/month paid by the month if you can figure out how to turn off all the extras!)
The only thing I would use them for (and still do) is registering domain names which they seem to do an okay job at.

service automatically renewing (Money reclaimed but still several hundred $ per time!). The problems (Shared hosing): - Internal updates in GoDaddys broke all my Wordpress sites on a 6 monthly basis. This required nearly 20-40 hours to fix each time! (Support was NOT helpful in any way shape or form) - The hosing was slow. I don't know how many people there are per server but it must be a lot. - The 'Unlimited' features are a long way from Unlimited. In fact they are the very opposite! - The script timeouts seem to also apply to their own website. Trying to download my data took a very long time. With frequent drop outs. - The MySql server is slow and drops out. Trying to download large databases is very difficult!"
"Obscure interface with hidden billing path. Hard to find how to cancel a product.
When you find it, you may get one of these meaningless messages
""Don't worry, we won't take it personal:This product cannot be canceled at this time. Please contact our customer service team for more information.""
So you have to call them to sort out the issue when it should take a single click. I am closing my account once and for all."
"They are not an Australian company. They use Australian phone no.s but do not have a local presence in Australia. GoDaddy is the worst business experience we have ever had. Ruthless business practices. Videoblocks, (another US company!) made an unauthorised transaction on our card, so our bank had to cancel the card with a chargeback. We had to wait a few days for the new card to arrive. However, without any notification via email, text or phone, GoDaddy deleted our corporate website that runs an educational program because we were late for a m... Read more

onthly payment of $10! It was after a few days we found out. We have been their customer for years, yet we could not reason out with them. Please refer to the links below, and understand how dangerously deceptive, and ruthless, this company and its staff members are. Thousands of customers have had heavy losses because GoDaddy's business practices are one sided. Customer care is not in their radar. When I finally managed to get a hold of them, GoDaddy said they sent us three ""failed billing notices"" to our email before taking our website away. Firstly, no, we haven't had any such GoDaddy ""failed billing notices"" in our email, not even in our spam folder. And, yes, we do have three Domain Notifications for a domain we cancelled a long time ago, which has nothing to do with our website. Secondly, I learnt from GoDaddy staff yesterday, that they send these ""failed billing notices"" to existing customers from their marketing department and not from the billing department just so that these notices go to customers' spam folder so they will not know that their websites would be deleted and then GoDaddy demands a restoration fee of $250 under threat of destroying the website information. I allege this to be extortion. We respectfully asked them to do what's right by us. Most of their staff members are sadistic, and get a sick satisfaction when customers call in a panic after seeing their website disappeared. I had to research for hours to get their USA phone no.s and read reviews on USA Better Business Bureau. I then spent hours to get a hold of their staff just to gather what their practices are and why they would do such a bizarre thing. The first two put me on hold saying they were transferring me to a supervisor, and after half an hour or so I hung up realising they were dishonest and wanted me to tire of holding. The third person was mocking at me that it was their right to take our website because we didn't pay. The fourth person insisted, talking over me constantly, that they sent out notices even though I said we haven't received any. He condescendingly demanded that I deal with Gmail if the notices were in my Spam folder. The fifth person from billing dept said that so many customers have had my experience. I asked her, even though we haven't had any GoDaddy email notices sent to us, if it was the billing department that send out these ""failed billing notices"" they refer to, and she said no, it was the Marketing Department. She then said GMail is not good and that we should buy their product for email as its better than GMail and that their notices would not have gone to Spam folder if we had their product! She even discussed the cost of their email product with me. I persevered so I could get to the bottom of this scam for the sake of all Australian consumers. Please, fellow Australians, avoid them like the plague before you lose your precious website that is worth thousands of $$$$ and your good reputation, for the inadvertent delay of payment of a $10 subscription. Go to Singaporean companies. Very ethical, and legally safe: https://www.bbb.org/…/godaddycom-llc-1126-22000…/complaints… https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.godaddy.com"
I registered a business name with Australia Government which I took photo of time and that the fact that the domain.com was available. I then visited your website and typed it in to buy it for .99 cents only to be forced to call you to be advised it was just bought five minutes ago!! Instead of 99 cents it would be $112 but because it was listed for sale go daddy are sure they could secure it for me. outraged. scam. asked for management - tried again had when called back and have been blocked. no where to send complaints on your website. this is an outrage
"Hi we are a corporate client with over ten established websites
Go Daddy took our money to back up our sites, but failed to make the back ups
Subsequently 2 of our sites went down and the back ups could not be reinstated for obvious reasons.

I discovered they have no local Australian Premises and operate our of Arizona.

GoDaddy admitted liability to me and offered me free hosting for three years as compensation but the sites will cost us about $8000 to recreate

Despite having a team of developers (they did not offer to rebuild the sites at their cost

Beware of this organisation as in my view it has no ethics and does not act honourably when confronted with an error on its part"
"What happened to GoDaddy? Customer service was excellent. Now it’s extremely poor. GoDaddy demanded a copy of a government issued ID to “verify credit card details” but not one of their policies stipulates how that information would be safeguarded, and how they would anonymise any information post verification. Two emails written in simple English were dismissed by the “customer service” representative. A request for a senior customer service manager to contact me was ignored. A formal complaint was lodged with the Bureau of Consumer Protection. Once my current hosting expires, I’m taking my business elsewhere."
"They provide poor service. Can't contact them, over 30 minutes on hold. Gave up. No matter how many times I cancelled the auto renewal payment, they keep stealing my money. It took way too much pain to cancel their service for it to not be intentional. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
I made a typo while trying to visit facebook and ended up on a Fake Virus page that said I have a virus and need to call a number to get it fixed. I did a whois search and found that was a godadddy domain. I reported this to godaddy and they still haven't removed it (it's been 3 days since I reported it). As I was visiting a page that they have control over I feel that I'm a customer and have written this review of their service (or lack of).

"I can't remember the name of the last consultant I spoke to (and I am actually upset at that fact) because he was genuinely very helpful and anticipated my every requirement without even having to really go through the history of my last 4-5 calls which got me nowhere.  It took him 1 min to get up to speed compared to the other consultants I spoke to except the person that signed me up to WordPress.

I was also meant to get a call back 1 day after talking to the second last consultant I was in contact with but this did not happen.  Instead I called 4 days later, but it was a blessing because of the excellent service that I received.

It took him no longer than 5 minutes to fix my issue, but he spent about another 10 - 15 mins listening to what I am trying to accomplish with my business and how to go forward from here.  I wish we had longer to talk to him because with his help, I really could have developed a complete plan for a CRM to meet all my business needs not just for the foreseeable future but looking years down the track.

Personally, if I had access to someone like that prior to my first purchases with GoDaddy 2 years ago, the company would be miles ahead. This is because we went with the wrong products, did not follow through etc...

The great thing about the advise given to me was instead of just trying to sell me products, he actually talked like a business consultant and was really honest as to when I would need what product going forward.  To be honest, the purchase made on GoDaddy about a week ago would have been the only one for the next 3 years (except email addresses).  But with the explanation of how certain products can help me make money actually opened my eyes on the benefits on spending money on the right products which he listed for me and told me when I should go ahead with.  That is what I liked best, it was the honesty.

I don't know if your company sells services to help people come up with plans for their sites, but this is one example of how it could work.  It could be even better with teleconferencing so that when explaining, the consultant can use a whiteboard to draw.

Anyway, that is my 2 cents.  You guys would probably say my 2 pennies though...."

Zara was able to do all of this with incredible professional style and also a very real sense of humour over the 40 minutes I was talking to her. 5 stars is not adequate enough in my opinion to rate the quality of her service. I have come away a very happy bunny!"

love go daddy. They have tremendous support 24/7 and its an easy site to use for technodunderheads like me. So easy to update your website and no need to pay anyone else to do it for you. Such a brilliant asset. Love love love go daddy
"There are few web hosting companies quite as iconic or with the same name recognition a GoDaddy, at least for those residing in the United States. They were founded back when web hosting was not nearly as popular as it is today and they have done amazing things in terms of making the service more accessible for the average, ordinary Joe or Jane. But is GoDaddy still as relevant today as they have been over the past two decades? We’ll let you decide.

GoDaddy (formerly Jomax Technologies) was founded in the year 1997 by Bob Parsons. He headquartered the company in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA and that is where it still resides. GoDaddy is a publicly traded company that is recognized for being the largest ICANN-accredited domain name registrar, with many millions of domain names processed through their online marketplace. They are a global corporation with datacenters and support staff located throughout the world.

What sets GoDaddy apart from its competitors is, most notably, their marketing and advertising. They were one of the very first companies to actively promote their brand. In 2005, they were the first web hosting company to pay for one of the world’s most expensive television ads – during the Super Bowl – but the risk paid off. The ad was quite racy and provoked a lot of backlash from family viewers but as someone famous once said, “There is no such thing as bad publicity.”

That Super Bowl ad was the kicking-off point for GoDaddy’s rise in brand recognition and popularity. They quickly became known as the place to purchase cheap domain names as well as offer up existing domains for auction, with their web hosting services taking a back seat.

GoDaddy Offers Everything You Need To Build An Online Presence

Today, GoDaddy provides a 365 degree experience for the person or company who wants an online presence. They offer a little bit of everything, with the exception of cloud hosting. Their services and products include domain name transactions and privacy as well as domain investment tools, standalone website builder and ecommerce tools, a full complement of design services, shared hosting, managed WordPress hosting, VPS and dedicated server packages, SSL certificates and site protection, marketing tools, email software and an online bookkeeping system.

GoDaddy – Plenty of Options But Not Necessary The Best

It is an attractive proposition for many small businesses to have all their internet needs met via one provider – but that is not necessarily the best option. While you will find a complete menu of services here, they are not always best in class or even the most economically priced. While GoDaddy calls their support “award-winning,” not all their customers would agree; they tend to get low scores across the board on helpfulness and quick response times. Their shared hosting plans are quite inexpensive, but not as feature-rich as many other web hosting services provide; nothing unique here. Another issue is that the online customer portal is clunky and not intuitive, which creates its own set of support problems due to things like inadvertent domain name expiration and outdated credit card information.

GoDaddy Hosting Review – Is GoDaddy a Good Host?

Some people are most comfortable using a company that is considered one of the largest in its industry. GoDaddy grew exponentially due largely to their innovative marketing but they have lost the personal touch and responsive service that you will find with many of their competitors, such as Inmotion Hosting or SiteGround.

Have been using Godaddy for many years. Over ten years. Delighted with product and service.
"I can't say enough great things. This was a fun, easy and creative process that I thoroughly enjoyed. If I got stuck on something someone was available to assist and was very personable and helpful."
Very helpful
"spend ages building a website and they delete it, then buy another years hosting and the web builder doesn't work and i cant get my website designed to how i want it. i cant even change the font even though i was clicking the different fonts to choose from, wix seems a lot easier wish i stuck with them now"
I have 2 websites with you.  I even hired your staff to help me with the first one: releaseyourpastoday.com.  I went on it yesterday and it was NOTHING like I had designed it to be and in fact there was a lot of garbage added to it that had been deleted a looooong time ago.  WHY would you go in and mess around with my website. I sure didnt' do it.   Very disappointed to say the least.  Please leave my new blog doggyjabber.com alone.  If you know of a reason why this would have happened I would love to hear it.
It mostly is very easy to make your website but I wish phone numbers could be made clickable.

"What a wonderful team of friendly and helpful individuals!  From my very first conversation, your representatives have done a fantastic job of answering my questions and making me feel more confident in my decision to update and move my employer's website.  I truly appreciate all their help and humor throughout the process.  Thank you so much for being a company that cares about their customer!"
Great products and great support available anytime - Klavs was a star helping me out today!
"GoDaddy was easy to understand and navigate. It would be nice to have a 'complete' package for small business that include the domain, webpage and marketing. The site has changed a bit as it use to offer personal choice of your own background in all sections. I do like GoDaddy and trust them with my webpage."
"My initial interaction was not thorough as I would have liked, I had a domain to be transferred and the agent just made the assumption of what I needed to do as opposed to reading my request thoroughly. I would not recommend chat messaging, if you have specific questions and need guidance. My next two interactions were via telephone and each agent was very helpful and knowledgeable.This was great considering, I was completely new to the whole website adventure. Bo was awesome and James had the patience of Job."
"I have paid for my domain name and website, a considerable amount of money and my website is not working when I google it."
"the pricing is a bit misleading! It starts to show a small amount for registering a domain, But things keep adding until becomes a lot"
Courteous and got my problems fixed immediately
"I think I had an unusual request for the home page. 
The initial person I talked to really did not know how to help me. The only answers were that I could not do what I wanted to do. I finally said ""how do I get my money back"" and she said ""call the accounting department and gave me their phone number"" 
I was a little shocked at that response. So I said wait a minute. Let me talk to a programmer. She then gave me that number.
Oh my goodness ....the tech I got worked very hard to give me what I wanted. I was so surprised and happy with what he did. 
I have just been playing around with it and I do have a ton of questions.  I am going to try and solve them for myself before I call for help again. 
I am so excited that I am going to get the website I want. I just know it."

This time I was told by the employee that there would be NO refund. That's correct, NO refund of the $719 charge even though they only hosted the site for less than two months. No proration at all. This is robbery and shameful. Godaddy should be ashamed treating long time customers this way. I have been using them for domains and sites for over 16 years.

"GoDaddy is world's biggest domain registrar - I personally use GoDaddy services to register and manage most of my domains. But when it comes to hosting, I think GoDaddy is just average. There are plenty of choices around which are cheaper and better than the Daddy. Read on to find out more."
Godaddy let's scammers use their services. Hosting viruses and all sorts of other illegal activity.
"A Convenient Host for Individuals and Starter Resellers
Despite a few kinks in its support and pricing, GoDaddy does provide an easy,painless website hosting experience.
GoDaddy is first and foremost a hosting provider that caters to those new to the hosting scene or who want a very simple hosting experience. That said, it does provide a few advanced features that will accommodate customers with more complex requirements. All of GoDaddy’s services and features are easy to purchase and set up; everything is accessible via an intuitive and clutter-free interface.
It’s not all good news, though. One of the most frequent complaints about GoDaddy is that it has tricky refund policies and that the platform has a lot of upsells. This means that you might end up paying extra for the convenience the platform offers.
So, whether GoDaddy is the right host for you or not, you’ll have to carefully read over the fine print &#8212; especially in terms of what you’ll end up paying long-term. If you do eventually decide to go with GoDaddy, then it’s definitely a very user-friendly and polished service.
Before you make a decision, we highly recommend you check out some alternative hosting companies, which we highly recommend.
Is GoDaddy Any Good? GoDaddy is a decent host if you don�t need a huge amount of resources or you�re just getting started with web hosting.
Do You Have to Use the GoDaddy Website Builder? No, GoDaddy offers regular shared hosting plans that you can use with apps like WordPress or Joomla.
Is Bluehost Better than GoDaddy? Both Bluehost and GoDaddy are budget shared hosting providers and both have their pros and cons. Make sure you read our full comparison review of Bluehost vs GoDaddy before you make your decision.
What Happens to Expired Domains on GoDaddy? When you allow a domain to expire with GoDaddy, you can recover it within 25 days. After this period, the domain will be listed for auction on GoDaddy Auctions.
Is GoDaddy Good for E-commerce? GoDaddy has some decent options for e-commerce, including an e-commerce plan which incorporates a website builder with online store features. You could also create a WordPress website and use WooCommerce to open an online store.

"We're considering moving all our domains to another registrar. At the moment (and for a while now) it's impossible to update our domains to use our own nameservers. This is your core business but it seems like your support team can't resolve this issue for us?!

And to be honest since you asked for our feedback. Your website is slow, clumsy and very difficult to use. It's amazing that everything still requires a full page reload as you move from form to form. And then often the requests fail, images on the page fail to load and the core service (e.g. update nameserver) is just broken.

We've used you for years but this really is now wasting a lot of our time and you are not providing the service we pay you for!"
Great service do it yourself approach
"It was very easy to set up my domain and emails
Step by step instructions by godaddy made it ease 
Excellent service"
Happy with getting my Domain name but disappointed that After a lengthy telephone conversation with your sales Person he did about my email and Websites he did not mention that I needed a host. I am a new start up business so all this is new to me and could have done with a bit of guidance/ info
"Everything is going good now 
Thank you very much"
My go to place to pay for all my domains for the past decade! The customer service is 2nd to none. They are always willing to go out of their way to help their customers. Thank you!
Domain hunter GoDaddy! Worst service I've ever seen in Domain hosting arena. They are asking $149.99 just for a simple 1-minute backup and restore tasks from their end.
Absolutely love ❤️
"To whom it may concern,

In my opinion you guys could have been more flexible.

I made a spelling mistake when I was registering my domain in order to correct it and I gave you guys a call at the same day to sort it out for me.
The service provided over the phone was great, however, I had to pay extra $27.45 to get it sorted for me.
I think to exceed costumers expectations you could have done it for free as it was a simple spelling mistake.

Best regards,

Diego Turela de Lima"
"Bought their domain broker service. Waited about 2 months only to be told they couldn't establish communication with the domain owner. Then I had to spend about 2 hours trying to explain godaddy customer service why I'm asking for a refund.

Got the refund in the end but they didn't want to untill I showed them the screenshots of emails I sent before that were never answered by godaddy."
Roy was very helpful today and it was great working with him to get our questions answered!
Awesome customer service!
I like working with GoDaddy because they are always willing to help customers.
"Fantastic customer service.  Any time I call everyone is pleasant, friendly, and very knowledgeable.  Can't go wrong with GoDaddy!"
Every time I try to log in it takes me to another screen to pay more.
"I had a GREAT experience with GoDaddy Website support last night! It was the first time I have used their helpline, and the service was fantastic. They answered the phone promptly, he stayed on the line and explained things without making me feel like an idiot, connected with other staffers and resolved ALL the problems. I recommend GoDaddy Website Builder to all my friends and family. It is affordable, intuitive, and has all the tools most people need. Now I can say they have GREAT customer support!"
Great job thanks
Great service and helpful when starting out.
This is my first time setting up a website and yes I've been a little frustrated but they are available for live chat to walk you through it. At first it was like getting driving directions and didn't want to do it but now I'll be chatting all the time. The price is right too.
"GoDaddy is exceptionally well-known in the hosting space, typically serving as site owners' introduction to the world of web hosting. The company makes it incredibly easy and affordable for folks to choose a domain name, sign up for hosting, and start building their online business or personal web property. While known for its domain, email, and shared hosting services, GoDaddy offers options for virtual and dedicated servers as well. The company makes the upgrade process as seamless as possible, so you shouldn't shy away from scaling your site as your business needs grow; GoDaddy is a hosting home that will grow alongside you.

The user control options are pretty popular in the hosting space: your choice between the easy-to-use cPanel or Plesk control panels, plus root (administrative) access for more tech-savvy customers. If you're particularly interested in webmail, GoDaddy offers an intuitive interface for keeping up with the unlimited email accounts you have available to you as a customer. All of this can be easily accessed and secured with your GoDaddy login info that you receive upon sign-up.

Customer support has been a focus of the GoDaddy team of late. Today, the team has an award-winning collection of experts on staff, readily available to handle customer support tickets and emails 24 hours a day, seven days a week. While they're on hand to talk you through any issues, they're also keeping an eye on your server (as well as other clients sharing your server). The company's around-the-clock security monitoring enables GoDaddy to guarantee uptime rates of 99.9% or better. This uptime rate is by no means outstanding in the industry, but for most end users, it's all that's required. 

The bottom line is this: GoDaddy is a go-to domain web host for millions of users worldwide for a reason. The company maintains an ever-expanding network of users by offering blazing-fast load times, award-winning security and support, and a free domain name when you sign up for a year-long plan. It's a great hosting deal, particularly for first-timers and small businesses owners, at a really great price point.

	There are options for one-click installs of content management systems such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and others.

 GoDaddy has long been the go-to solution for beginners just starting out with web hosting. The company's newly released and simplified interface, 1-click application installs, and upgraded support means we can recommend them with confidence. GoDaddy relies on familiar and user-friendly platforms, such as cPanel, Softaculous, CentOS, and Microsoft Office 365, that customers are sure to appreciate. A streamlined drag-and-drop site builder and extensive knowledgebase, coupled with around-the-clock support, mean anyone can design, create, launch, and grow a site within minutes. &quot;Economy&quot; Plan: $1.00/month &quot;Deluxe&quot; Plan: $4.99/month &quot;Ultimate&quot; Plan: $5.99/month Pricing for GoDaddy hosting is very economical at every level, particularly when you consider all the free perks included with the low prices. The company's shared hosting naturally lead the charge on cost-effective hosting, but budget-minded customers can find surprising deals with upgraded VPS and dedicated server plans, as well. The 99.9% uptime guarantee makes it difficult for us to rank GoDaddy among the top providers of the hosting world, as that rate is largely considered the minimum standard in the industry. For most users, however, 99.9% uptime is absolutely plenty. If your website or application requires a higher guaranteed uptime rate, you should consider more premier (and higher priced) hosts or upgraded services. godaddy Includes: 24/7 Phone, Chat, Twitter, and Email Support, Extensive Online Help Center, and Ticketing System To recap, here's a rundown of what GoDaddy has to offer: GoDaddy is a good value in the hosting space — boasting a very low cost for shared hosting services and long-standing credibility in the domain hosting industry. With hosting available for as little as a dollar per month, it's hard to beat the company's price point. By recently revamping its user interface to improve the customer experience, GoDaddy is taking user-friendliness and responsive support to new heights. The company's around-the-clock service features 24/7 server monitoring and an emphasis on balancing performance and security. Although GoDaddy's uptime guarantee isn't outstanding, the company's page load speeds and general reliability are impressive. All in all, GoDaddy is a reliable option to accommodate your hosting needs."
"GoDaddy is a well-rounded hosting provider, offering four different types of hosting (shared, VPS, Dedicated, and WordPress) and an array of brilliant features. Its pricing plans aren't cheap, but all the extras make GoDaddy a bit special. Alongside hosting, it has a website builder and is the world's largest domain registrar."
Good for domain and basic services like hosting. Customer service is good if you are lucky and get a US based agent.
Overnight they did something to cause a complete change in how to get into my email account.  I could not access my email account.  Called several times and they had no clue what they did or how to fix it.  Went a week without getting into my emails.  Still can&#039;t.  I cannot believe they create a problem and then can&#039;t solve it.  Too bad they don&#039;t know the words &quot;customer service.&quot;
"GoDaddy has to be the worst company to work with. It has taken us 15 days to transfer a domain and it still hasn&#039;t happened yet. Nobody should work with GoDaddy. You are warned.

I was on chat and calls so many times. Our tech team was on it so many times. but there is always something else they tell you. Basically they block it in the backend stopping you from transferring your domain."
"I have been using GoDaddy for the last 5 years. I haven&#039;t had any problems with them. Good promotions let you buy domains at a good price. Easy to buy, easy to use. I like it."
I am their client for almost 2 years but every time I need support they are not available fast. I have to wait for a long time.
"They slowed our site to try and sell a new $4,300 server sollution! We moved to AWS for $3.50 month. Site was not the cause of slow response. GD did it! 
If your site has a 20 second lag you are losing visitors!"
"If you are after a quality service (with quality customer service), your best option is NameCheap. GoDaddy is outrageously bad at managing any customer issues. Their products simply do not work and they are always unwilling to provide you with a refund for non-working products.

They took the liberty to create a non-working email address for a domain that they don&#039;t manage (Unbelievable!). If the domain is not under their management it is impossible to have a working email address... Godaddy does not seem to understand that...

They also don&#039;t understand that, under the Fair Trade Act, they are obliged to address non-working products after their BS 30-day money back guarantee.

With NameCheap they keep your domain private for FREE and the domains and hosting plans are way cheaper than GoDaddy. They are super fast at responding to your requests and fix problems straight away. I am very glad that I&#039;ve found a great alternative to this shambles of a company."
"I enjoyed using Godaddy.  They use excellent support, especially if you are active in the process.

I understand prices are a little high.  Really do you homework.  Make sure you understand the difference between web hosting and site hosting, etc."
"There is no option in Godaddy&#039;s website to file a complaint which is the usual thing companies do to encourange communication and feedback between the company and their clients.

I have been using Godaddy for years and I feel totally cheated. Since users can&#039;t write nor chat to obtain support and users can just call, I have been &#039;helped&#039; by call agents. Those have given me wrong advise I see now that I have been paying as if I were a company with 25-30 websites when I just am a normal simple home user with one website.
I don&#039;t have much money but now I am stuck with paying 50 euros per month for services I have never and will never use. I have been totally cheated by Godaddy. I have never felt this way with anohter company. I have lost at last 2000 euros, but it feels worse. I feel I have ben cheated 2000 euros.

It seems the call agents work on commission and they have just sold me anything that was good for them and not for me. I insist, it&#039;s very hard for me to pay that money and I am not even using it. I am leaving Godaddy as soon as possible.

I want to ask a refund for having been mislead with information about hosting services I never needed.

It&#039;s very horrible that Godaddy behaves this way."
"The site is amazing ,the language is quite easy to read an navigate.Anyone would easily understand the language."
Godaddy made me buy the wrong product 3 times and they decline to refund me. every time I call or email them they tell me that they&#039;ll get back to me but they won&#039;t.
"You are still keeping your intellectual property - domains and sites assets with GoDaddy? YOU ARE DEAD!!!!!!!!!!! Run for your life if you still can!!!!
Here are the reasons. First of all they treat their clients like dirt. Having bunch of sweet sugar-candy youngsters to answer you on a phone is not a &quot;providing service&quot;. We left this company 7 months ago, after absolutely unspeakable incident - they blocked our web-site, known media source with 1 million readers... just because they can, and because I&#039;m an idiot - I made a decision to host our media with them in the first place. And now we live happily ever after with another hosting provider, very well, and secure, and specially me, as I&#039;m the one who&#039;s responsible for all web development in our company. We paid about 2000$ a year to GoDaddy. Who cares, right? GoDaddy happily participate in all unfair competition actions and felonies organized in USA, and block European commpanies during the time of the high sales. For the last 2 years GoDaddy lost millions of their clients, including shareholders. Check their stock....
Second of all - prices: GoDaddy make you feel that their services are cheap. Oh no!!!!! You actually pay very high price for domains - you can get them much cheaper with another provider and you don&#039;t need to be in their domain club - that&#039;s how they collect TVA taxes back if you are buying on behalf of the company and have your taxes reduced. Today for the same number of the domains and super hosting plans, private servers, protected against Ddos attacks, CDN etc (much higher than we had at GoDaddy) we pay alsmost hald price. In total we save about 500$ a year. 
So and the third reason - QUALITY!
GoDaddy propose to you all kind of hostings, private servers etc.... all of these are VERY OLD, NOT SECURED  HARDWARE, which should be in the garbage. Recently May 4th, 2020 sites, 28,000 hosted with GoDaddy sites GOT HACKED!!!!!!!! Wordfence developers (known security plugin) received this information and publicly announced it. Details see on their blog. Short version: servers of GoDaddy are NOT SECURED AND NOT PROTECTED! Nothing against Ddos attacks has been done. I remember how many times our web-site was down because of that when we hosted it with GoDaddy. Our company had massive financial damages...... GoDaddy selling you place on very old server, no security, no nothing, nada, for very high price. So all databases hosted on them got hacked, 28,000 clients have no access to their databases, not by php client, not by ftp, and many have their sites simply down!!!! Congratulations!!!!!! There you go, GoDaddy, results are very well deserved!!!!! I personally glad they got it, and I also hope that poor clients who got hacked will file massive lawsuit against GoDaddy, and demand financial damages for their hacked web-sites.
And!!!!!! GoDaddy and &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group&quot; FELONY DISCLOSURE. Probably the feature POLICE case. Did you ever had this situation: you look for the domains for your company or for your client (and specially if you have a brand client with trademarks registered), and many times the domain is already taken, and GoDaddy propose you to pay 60$ to negotiate? Or you buy quiet expensive from &quot;private user&quot; domain in the auction? Yep, there&#039;s it is. And GoDaddy will never show who owns the domain of your client&#039;s brand. Many times you see this when you check for the owner in WHOIS other sources: &quot;Name Management Group, LLC (Nanci Nette), 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US&quot;. 
When you see this know that this &quot;Nanci Nette from Name Management Group&quot; is actually GoDaddy itself. 
I&#039;m going to lay down discovered facts. There&#039;s no such person as Nanci Nette, not a single social media profile. This so called &quot;Name Management Group, LLC&quot; simply doesn&#039;t exist in the California registry, and never existed (checked). And you can see the records of this Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC: this non-existing company owns about 45000 domains! And all of them only with GoDaddy!!! Address: 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US belongs to THE AVENUE - luxury apartments for rent. Yep!!!! All letters, including legal services (thousands of them) transferred to GoDaddy address, according to information provided by management of THE AVENUE. 
And of course I strongly suggest you to Google &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; - you will see thousands lawsuits for &quot;domain squatting&quot;. &quot;Domain squatting&quot; is ownership of the domains corresponding to brands names. For example I have company &quot;My Domain&quot;, I own trademarks, I also have a domain &quot;mydomain.com&quot; and &quot;mydomain.net&quot;, but I didn&#039;t purchase &quot;mydomain.org&quot; and &quot;mydomain.info&quot; or &quot;mydomain.co.uk&quot;. Be sure that &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; / GoDaddy bought it and wants to sell them to you for very high price. And also check how all lawsuits are going. This &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; never responds to the complaint and judge orders to transfer the domain to the company who filed a complaint. GoDaddy does the transfer very quickly! Yep, all lawsuits go in this scenario! Little trick here though. Letting GoDaddy &quot;to negotiate&quot; the domain for you / or buying domain at the GoDaddy auction will be always less expensive than filing the lawsuit in WIPO or ICANN. Yep!!!!! GoDaddy FELONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"If there was a zero star, I would allocate this!!!! Started to deal with GoDaddy in early 2009 when I had an online company and found their front line support team were AMAZING, HELPFUL, POLITE &amp; RESPECTFUL. But that&#039;s where it ends, I have just wasted 15 hours on the phone to them, on 3 occasions a supervisor was supposed to call me and NEVER called - I finally sat on hold today for an hour waiting and actually spoke to a Floor Supervisor called Marcos, so they are actually real!!! Only to be told, too bad, it&#039;s your problem, we can&#039;t help you - regardless that it was the GoDaddy staff who created the problem..... cannot believe a company can treat a customer of 11 years like this.

I purchased my domain name for email purposes in August 2014 through GoDaddy and this all ran through my Personal Microsoft account which has my Microsoft Office 365 subscription. Through my Outlook app I ran both my personal email and business email.

In August 2018 I received my GoDaddy Domain renewal and the costs were 2.5 times more expensive than when I had set up the whole thing with them in 2014. I called the support crew and spoke with someone there and asked why were the costs so high? He stated he could put me on a cheaper program which was email only (as I didn&#039;t need an actual website) however it would mean I may lose some data. I told I needed to keep the costs as low as possible so we went ahead  at no time did he mention he would need to create a 2nd Microsoft Account and have it listed as a Business Plan Account.

In early March 2020 I had issues of my Outlook always asking for my email password and I called their centre at least 4 times and reset the password, tried security on the account nothing stopped the password locking  they advised me there was another device trying to log in with an old password. This could not be as I had signed out of my old devices and did a factory reset before disposing of them.

Last Sunday March 22, 2020 we finally worked out that I had 2 Microsoft accounts .... I was then advised that the business Online Plan 1 Account did not allow for me to use the Outlook app as it was not included in the subscription. They then advised I needed to speak with Microsoft and request for the two accounts to be merged .... see via separate email a copy of the log from when I contacted Microsoft who explained me the situation that the two accounts are on different servers and could not be merged but maybe Outlook.com could offer me a solution. I REALLY do not want to change my email address again and I need the data from my Exchange account such as emails, contacts, calendar etc.

GoDaddy have basically thrown me under the bus, I am now stuck with having to do the following:
Run my Work Email with no contacts or calendar through the Office 365 Outlook app AND my personal exchange email account through the standard windows 10 Mail app for PC which contains all of my personal &amp; work contacts plus my calendar, again personal &amp; work all in one place"
"Customer Support is excellent!
Amazing experience using their services for the first time. 
5 stars FOR SURE!"
"Do Not go to go daddy they have continued to charge my credit card for three months after i canceled.
If you talk to Julian&lt; who is supposed  to be in charge of cancellations, Do not belive a word he SAYS!!!!,
STAY AWAY FROM GO DADDY"

Haven&#039;t much to say. Really happy about your service guys! Use it for my online store and definitely recommend to all
"There are few web hosting companies quite as iconic or with the same name recognition a GoDaddy, at least for those residing in the United States. They were founded back when web hosting was not nearly as popular as it is today and they have done amazing things in terms of making the service more accessible for the average, ordinary Joe or Jane. But is GoDaddy still as relevant today as they have been over the past two decades? We’ll let you decide.

GoDaddy (formerly Jomax Technologies) was founded in the year 1997 by Bob Parsons. He headquartered the company in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA and that is where it still resides. GoDaddy is a publicly traded company that is recognized for being the largest ICANN-accredited domain name registrar, with many millions of domain names processed through their online marketplace. They are a global corporation with datacenters and support staff located throughout the world.

What sets GoDaddy apart from its competitors is, most notably, their marketing and advertising. They were one of the very first companies to actively promote their brand. In 2005, they were the first web hosting company to pay for one of the world’s most expensive television ads – during the Super Bowl – but the risk paid off. The ad was quite racy and provoked a lot of backlash from family viewers but as someone famous once said, “There is no such thing as bad publicity.”

That Super Bowl ad was the kicking-off point for GoDaddy’s rise in brand recognition and popularity. They quickly became known as the place to purchase cheap domain names as well as offer up existing domains for auction, with their web hosting services taking a back seat.

GoDaddy Offers Everything You Need To Build An Online Presence

Today, GoDaddy provides a 365 degree experience for the person or company who wants an online presence. They offer a little bit of everything, with the exception of cloud hosting. Their services and products include domain name transactions and privacy as well as domain investment tools, standalone website builder and ecommerce tools, a full complement of design services, shared hosting, managed WordPress hosting, VPS and dedicated server packages, SSL certificates and site protection, marketing tools, email software and an online bookkeeping system.

GoDaddy – Plenty of Options But Not Necessary The Best

It is an attractive proposition for many small businesses to have all their internet needs met via one provider – but that is not necessarily the best option. While you will find a complete menu of services here, they are not always best in class or even the most economically priced. While GoDaddy calls their support “award-winning,” not all their customers would agree; they tend to get low scores across the board on helpfulness and quick response times. Their shared hosting plans are quite inexpensive, but not as feature-rich as many other web hosting services provide; nothing unique here. Another issue is that the online customer portal is clunky and not intuitive, which creates its own set of support problems due to things like inadvertent domain name expiration and outdated credit card information.

GoDaddy Hosting Review – Is GoDaddy a Good Host?

Some people are most comfortable using a company that is considered one of the largest in its industry. GoDaddy grew exponentially due largely to their innovative marketing but they have lost the personal touch and responsive service that you will find with many of their competitors, such as Inmotion Hosting or SiteGround.

"I&#039;ve been a Godaddy customer for over a decade. Recently, the company has been changing fast and adopting certain predatory behaviors. On November the 4th, 2019, I received a notice that my domain expired on October the 31st because of an &quot;invalid or expired credit card&quot;. That was a surprise since all my other domains were being auto-renewed regularly. Also, I received no notice about any attempt to charge said invalid payment method. I checked my account and indeed, the Capital One card that was subject to leak by the company and exposed me to fraud and theft was there. However, there were three other payment methods (debit and credit cards), all valid. There is a reason a customer provides several payment methods when the company allows (and encourages) this: when something happens to one, the company charges the next. That&#039;s not what Godaddy did: they cancelled my domain but they offered to retrieve it from the &quot;parked nameservers&quot; for a $80 fee. In my understanding, this is extorsion. Apparently, they agree with me (that this is an illegal practice) since I called them the following day, I was very clear that they would be reported in case they refused to fix the situation and indeed they fixed it immediately. On November 10, 2019, again I received an email from Godaddy about an expired product due to &quot;invalid or expired payment method&quot;. Now they have no reason to claim that since I deleted all the other cards, leaving only my one very valid debit card on file. This is another attempt from Godaddy to inflict small damages, with small irregularities that their customer service agents are completely unsuccessful in fixing. The last one dropped the line (accidentally?) and the next one came asking for the same information. Keeping me all that time online creates a debt from Godaddy to me. I will bill them for that because there are too many red flags that this was a malicious action. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#039;t. Let Godaddy choose which it is: if they pay, showing willingness to meet their damaged customers half-way, then they look good. Otherwise, they strengthen my hypothesis."
"They sound inexpensive at first. They are not! they are ridiculously expensive. Just wait for an auto-renewal, they will sneak in a nice price hike &quot;after your promotion ended&quot;.

Terrible business model!

They charged me an &quot;auto-renewal&quot;, and since I wasn&#039;t expecting it, I didn&#039;t check my business credit card account. I found out when I got the late fee notification by mail from the credit card company.

At times like this, that amazon AWS charges cents for hosting ... this guys at GoDaddy auto-charged me over $600 dollars for &quot;shared hosting&quot; (your site in the same server along with hundred others competing for resources)

Called customer service. They just made me laugh: 
- they couldn&#039;t refund me because 30 days had passed. Of course! I didn&#039;t know they had charged me.
- the rep: named Landon (didn&#039;t want to provide last name) literally said: since you already (forcibly) paid for it, you might as well use it.

Just save yourself some headache. Stay away from this clown business."
"Provides good attention to the user.
It has easy payment plans and no commission
although I think they should put a chance to acquire it for free"
"Go daddy SEO services is a total scam . I have called in and canceled my service the 2nd day , spoke with a manager and said i will get my refund in few days , a week later no emails and they apparently working on the website. They are the worst ....never pay upfront for their seo service. they are horrible !!!!!"
"What a rip off!  Totally screwed by GoDaddy.  Paid for their service and have been mislead, misinformed, and flat out lied to by customer service.  After a month of being jerked around I asked today&#039;s supervisor named Caleb who I could speak with to lodge a complaint with and he said, no one.  I asked him how he was gong to handle the misinformation I previously received, he sent me an email on a totally unrelated subject.  GoDaddy just plain sucks"
"GoDaddy is a great domain name provider, however, its web hosting service is mid range. "
I LOVEd the new Austin office. I worked there since it was a start up and now that it is GoDaddy. It's a great work life balance and a great place to work with a great culture. Unfortunately I think they were still paying the employees start-up prices which almost didn't cover the cost of living for the area and the work that we were doing. I did love the management and the culture. If you're looking for your first job I would recommend it!
"Run. Run far, far away. It was great when it was MSH, but then we weren't anymore and things took a turn. If you are a tall man with a moderately high-priced ath-leisure (or business casual) wardrobe and full of clichés then you were literally made for the job- there is hope for you you bas tard. Otherwise, if you take the job, there is no bidding your time, there is no maybe it gets better, there is just no hope for you. You will not realize your potential and you will be worse off if you take the position. That said, I learned a lot- at the expense of my physical and mental health. I haven't worked there in 3+ months and I am still recovering. Not worth it, not worth it at all. HR won't do anything, nor will senior management even as they proclaim how wonderful and inclusive their culture is. Conditions are deplorable, and the culture is only for superficial children. Side note, the building you would work in will literally poison you with fluorescent light, and there is no place where you cannot be seen and heard. At all."
It’s a sales job I get it but paying us a slightly higher than minimum wage base is ridiculous. The culture wasn’t for me either. Very sales-y overhyped.
"The environment is testosterone and heavy and Sales focused.
There are plenty of opportunities for fun while you work, if you don't easily take things personally."
"The work is not only boring, but they keep giving you more and more until you can't remember what creativity even means -- which makes their constant push to be ""creative"" frustrating at best. The only thing they really care about is the bottom line -- not the customers and certainly not the employees. If they cared at all about the employees they'd be paid a fair wage. Not to mention the pay discrepancy among people with the same job, which they refused to address."
"100 cold dials daily, learn the full sales cycle from prospecting to closing, managers are good, good social aspect to the office and fun place to work"
The training was short but after that this is a great place to work. Benefits are good and the management is talented. Pay is good and goals are achievable.
"In the sales department, your supervisors care 10x more about numbers than your overall work flow. I have to say I had two different supervisors and one made me entirely hate my job, and the other was great until I felt like leaving, that supervisor pushed me to quit on the spot instead of putting my two weeks in because it would hurt his numbers, which makes sense but isn't very caring for their employees."
Terrible job and poor work environment. Loud and immature work area at times. Typical call center and once they feel too many are hitting sales quota they change the structure to make it more difficult
GoDaddy had great leadership. They put you in a position for advancement and everyday i learned something new. Although the culture was great at the end of the day they only care about making the company money. If your not liked or a top performer they find a way to get rid of you.
From training to first day on the job i was thrown in the water and told to swim. By the time i hit my 1st year 90% of my training class quit or got fired. It is a constant grind. Call after call. So many metrics to hit. Now i was one of the lucky ones who swam. I made great money but every year they cut my bonus. It came to a point where i had to ask what am i worth. Im doing the same job. Exceeding my peers and getting paid less. I felt im worth more than what they were offering. They dont really care to keep anyone from leaving. Your just a number on a excel sheet.
The pay is horrible for the work they require. To meet bonus range requires you to sacrifice your ethics and morals to push products on every customer even if they don't need it
"Loved the atmosphere, and the leadership, but when they wanted everyone to build revenue, it made the job aspects almost impossible, and really destroyed alot of work place structure."
They're more focused on numbers than their employees also super harsh with their attendance policy. If you like sales and making sure that your life is going to all about work it's a good place for you
GoDaddy has many great offices to work from along with allowing work from home. This office also offer's free parking and casual dress attire each day.
Godaddy does a really good job and making their locations a fun place to work. There are good opportunities especially if you are a smooth seller. Pay is competitive and bonuses are available if you sell past your quotas.
I recommend GoDaddy to anyone who wants a fun and exciting place to be. Very casual place and management was very helpful to anything you needed when on the job.
"Godaddy is an interesting company being that their structured to seem like tech support if you are the customer. But as someone who worked there, we definitely were not tech support, but more so website hosting sales. And most customers didn't know this. This made making sales a challenge and essentially required you to sit and really try to rope every single call into some sort of a sale. This puts a large pressure on you because there are a lot of times it does not feel appropriate to make a sales offer, but the job expects you to nonetheless. I personally did not fit with this aspect, the overall constant pressure of it. I performed well and hit my metrics on par with my team, even for an outsider, but this still just put a large hamper on my overall mental well being and had to depart. Most of the people I was hired with had quit before I did. Out of the 10 people hired with me, only 9 made it out of training, and after I left, there were only 2 left. However those 2 got promoted because they sold so much. And this companies bonus structure is very competitive and you definitely can make several thousand dollars a month off of bonuses. But you have to be okay with a nonstop pressure to sell in a very touchy environment that is also in an ever changing landscape that is ""internet services."""
GoDaddy provided me a place to grow my knowledge and improve my abilities of handling complex tasks and difficult problems. I had opportunities to grow in my career as well as the work life balance required to do so.
"The freedom to be who you are and do what you're passionate about is great here. It can be hard in certain operations roles to chart a career path and move up and onward, but there is a lot of opportunity for people who are willing to prioritize their own learning and can advocate for themselves."
"Satisfied to work in my first datacenter career. also love the company culture who helps each other closely. Also, the manager likes to help to work with an open mind."
"GoDaddy is world's biggest domain registrar - I personally use GoDaddy services to register and manage most of my domains. But when it comes to hosting, I think GoDaddy is just average. There are plenty of choices around which are cheaper and better than the Daddy. Read on to find out more."
"I m trying to purchase domain and join membership for selling domain but it is showing an unexpected error since last 15 days ,talked many times to customer support they only say change the browser, but instead of trying on Chrome,opera mini,and safari but same problem."
"We have given wrong advised and forced to cancel the hosting service in order to upgrade to c-panael hosting , initial they informed us that we will get a credit and once the cancellation happened they advised us of the extra to p... Read More
ay , not only that the website went down at no single time they advised us the our website will be down? and then they advised us it has to be restored inorder to bring it back and asked for more money, we had no other option but to accept the fee. We have been advised it will be back in 24hrs but after 2 days it was not up, we called to find out it will be 20 days!!! Seriously
It's really redicolus
We forced to cancel the service , not even got the upgrade, and we incur cost to bring it back and still waiting.
It's damaged our business and will be taking the matter further.
They are liers, they don't know what they are doing, you have to be careful, they are scam and avoid them by all means

"Are the GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans a good choice for your website?



It's no surprise that GoDaddy offers plans tailored to the most popular content management system (CMS) on the web (WordPress!). Depending on your needs, the handy features that GoDaddy's WordPress plans provide could help your website succeed.





For our GoDaddy review for WordPress, we'll take a closer look at the features it offers, as well as its support system, performance, and prices. Let's get to it!











⚙️ Features



GoDaddy boasts a lot of variety when it comes to hosting. It provides shared plans, virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated options, and of course, WordPress-specific offerings.



Here's a full breakdown of the features you can access with the Basic WordPress hosting tier:



Free business email and domain for one yearDaily malware scans with SucuriAutomatic backups with one-click restoreSFTP access to your serverOut-of-the-box integration with a content delivery network (CDN)Automatic WordPress core updates



It's a decent feature set, although there's nothing here that's particularly unique compared to other hosts. 



The Ultimate plan serves up additional features including unlimited malware removal and hack repair, and one-click staging.



More impressively, the Ecommerce plan includes free access to premium WooCommerce features and extensions like WooCommerce Subscriptions. The premium extensions alone are worth thousands of dollars and offer serious value if you're creating a WooCommerce store.



📞 Support options and quality



GoDaddy's support quality is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, it offers 24/7 availability all throughout the year. However, the easiest way to contact a specialist is via phone.



Whether that's a pro or a con depends on your personal preferences. Other options include searching the GoDaddy Help articles, seeking assistance via the community forums, or – if you can find it – a live chat option tucked into the Product Support page:







You have to set your region as the United States in order for the live chat button to appear, which can be confusing for some users. This option is also only available from 5am–6pm Mountain Time, making it somewhat inconvenient for GoDaddy's international customers.



While support availability is generally good, the quality itself can be hit or miss. In our 2018 WordPress hosting survey of over 830 users, GoDaddy received the following scores for support (out of 5):



Overall support: 3.3WordPress-specific support: 3.3



While not horrible, it's below many other cheap WordPress hosts:



SiteGround: 4.7 (overall) / 4.5 (WordPress-specific)InMotion: 4.2 / 3.8DreamHost: 4.0 / 3.9A2 Hosting: 3.7 / 3.6Bluehost: 3.2 / 3.4



🏎️ Performance



Performance is a vital consideration when choosing a web hosting plan. Website optimization will only take you so far if your server is sub-par. For our GoDaddy review for WordPress, we took a look at all the speed-boosting features it offers, such as:



CDN integration. As we mentioned earlier, all of GoDaddy's WordPress plans provide out-of-the-box CDN integration for increased site speed.Load-balanced, clustered server environments. GoDaddy's servers are optimized for WordPress. Additionally, they're prepared to handle traffic spikes that might otherwise crash your site.99.9% uptime guarantee. GoDaddy provides an uptime guarantee in its contracts that enables customers to request account credits in the amount of 5% of their monthly bill if it fails to meet the minimum requirement. 



Like the features available in GoDaddy's Basic WordPress hosting plan, nothing here stands out as particularly unique or better than other providers. However, you can rest assured that you're at least receiving decent performance optimization.



Basic load testing with Load Impact



In a nutshell, traditional performance tests paint only half a picture. Even if you get stellar results after multiple consecutive runs, that doesn't tell you how your server will fare if it faces a sudden influx of traffic.



Recently, we compared several of the most popular WordPress hosting providers, including GoDaddy. We ran some pretty exhaustive performance tests for each host, including some load impact analyses.



For our stress test, we used Load Impact and had it simulate up to 40 concurrent users for our GoDaddy WordPress site. Here are the minimum and maximum response times from our results:



Minimum response time: 0.63 secondsMaximum response time: 0.83 seconds



Those are respectable numbers for any web hosting service. They're not the fastest we've seen, but the results are right up there. Overall, the performance to price ratio you get with GoDaddy WordPress hosting is not terrible.



Uptime with our hosting monitor



Having your site's server up and running is crucial. When it's down, you're missing out on ad revenue, email subscriptions, sales, and page views. GoDaddy guarantees 99.9% uptime, but our hosting uptime monitor shows a noticeable difference with GoDaddy frequently coming in below that mark.







While the difference between 99.9% and 99.1% uptime might not seem like a lot, that comes out to almost six hours of added downtime per month, which is substantial.



As a silver lining, you would be able to get a 5% discount if your site goes under the 99.9% uptime guarantee.



💰 GoDaddy WordPress hosting pricing



When it comes to WordPress, GoDaddy offers a managed service at some of the lowest prices on the market.



GoDaddy falls firmly under the category of budget WordPress hosting, with its most expensive plan coming in at just $15.99 per month:







Here's what you get with each plan, beyond the features we discussed before:



Basic ($6.99 per month): 1 website, 30 GB of storage, and up to 25K monthly visitors.Deluxe ($9.99 per month): 1 website, 75 GB of storage, and up to 100K monthly visitors.Ultimate ($12.99 per month): 1 website, unlimited storage and visitors, and a free SSL certificate.Ecommerce ($15.99 per month):  1 website, unlimited storage and visitors, and a free SSL certificate. 



Unfortunately, GoDaddy only supports a single website on every one of its basic WordPress hosting plans, which is a massive downside even at these prices. If you want to host multiple sites, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro plans, which start at a pricier $24.99 per month.



Another important factor to be aware of is that many of the features GoDaddy promotes in conjunction with its WordPress plans are available for free via plugins. Its daily malware scans are performed by Sucuri, its 'SEO Optimizer' is just Yoast, and WooCommerce provides unlimited products and no transaction fees out of the box.



On a positive note, GoDaddy does bundle a lot of premium WooCommerce add-ons with its top tier. These extensions are collectively worth thousands of dollars per year, so it's worth considering if you're starting an online store with WooCommerce.



As usual, to get the prices you see on the website, you need to sign up for a long-term contract. The fees mentioned above are available for a minimum of 36-months, which is pretty standard for budget hosts. For month-to-month payments, the Basic plan goes up to $12.99 per month.



Why not use GoDaddy's cheap shared plans?



Finally, it's worth mentioning GoDaddy's basic shared hosting plan is only one dollar cheaper than its managed WordPress counterpart. 



Additionally, excluding the lowest tier, all of GoDaddy's shared plans let you host unlimited websites, whereas the GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans limit you to a single website.



Those shared plans still let you install WordPress with a one-click installer, so why not use them?



Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with doing that. But the benefit of the WordPress-specific plans is that you get access to optimized WordPress performance, as well as beneficial features such as:



Automatic updatesStaging sitesMalware and hack removalBundled WooCommerce plugins



*The exact features depend on which plan you sign up for.



➕➖ Overall pros and cons



To close out our GoDaddy review for WordPress, here's a summary of its best features:



Prices are among the best for managed WordPress plans.You get access to an excellent list of features (especially for eCommerce).The performance is solid for the price.



On the other hand, the biggest downside to GoDaddy's WordPress plans, in our opinion, is that they only support a single website. If you want to host multiple sites, you'll need to look into its Pro Plans.



Beyond that, GoDaddy makes it difficult to find and use its live chat support option, which is not optimal. It's also important to mention for those who aren't experienced WordPress users that many of the features it lists are available for free with Sucuri, Yoast, and WooCommerce.



🏆  GoDaddy WordPress hosting review conclusion





Not too long ago, GoDaddy was synonymous with terrible performance and support.



However, lately, it's been putting a lot of effort into offering better services across the board.











In a nutshell, GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans offer adequate performance and a pretty attractive feature lineup, especially for online stores. However, we can only recommend it if you're looking to host a single website. Otherwise, you're better off looking elsewhere.

"no point talking to the trashy salesman. the bean counters see a buck and go for it. ok I was a week overdue and they nailed and sold my domain name that I had held on to for 20 years.
they are scum."
I purchased a way cheaper business email address & web domain than what other companies offered. Happy with everything besides the fact that I have to log into Outlook and THEN Godaddy to access my emails. I hope there is an update soon where I can log in directly rather than double handling.
Spoke to 4 useless customer service people in a row. Spent over 2 hours on phone to them. The domain i owned and wanted to transfer was cancelled by one of those guys in the frustration of the calls even though i had renewal until 2021. They kept saying i did it. Hopeless. So much fluff. Frustrated as helL!
"Spent over an hour and a half online with an operator who had no idea what he/she was talking about. I asked for an email address that I could lodge a complaint with. Guess what..... no email address is available.
As soon as I figure out how to dump Godaddy and retain my email address and domain name I'll be changing.
Good grief. I've just read other reviews. I thought I might have been alone. This mob sound like they need to be investigated."
"They are the worst company I have dealt with, all they do is try to upsell you on stuff you don't need. They also say they want to help but never do.

My issue is that they charged me $240+ for an SSL certificate when they are advertising them at $14.95. When did I call them saying why are you advertising at this price but charging me so much? They stated 'it was a fake ad and the link won't direct me to the Go Daddy website and that they have NEVER done prices like this.

l of intelligence. WRONG! No apology either at this point. I then ask what can you do for me price-wise, I am happy to pay more but 7 times more is a joke, look after me as a customer. They said we can cancel the SSL and you can do this by yourself. Your website will go down until you reissue the SSL, we WON'T help you if you get stuck. Seriously? I am paying for a product! You need to provide it. They must love the Ferengi and the Rules of acquisition 'Once you have their money... you never give it back.' Because this is the vibe I get whenever I deal with them. Stay away. Once my good friend who is in IT able to I am changing everything away. They don't care about customer retention even though it takes more money to get a new one than it does to keep one. Learn some good business Go Daddy!"
"The sale person misled me to think $417 webhosting renewal include SSL Certificate, I am not happy with Sale misled me that to believe the Hosting total $417 included the SSL price, instead of extra $337.93 on top of hosting renewal become total $754.93
however, I only found out when credit card statements, He deducted an extra $337.93 on top of $417, makes the total bill $754.93
When I want to complaint, the supervisor to me to go to US legal dept, NOT in Australia base."
"Business email price increases every year. Move to DreamIT this year after the price increased double. The new email hosting price is less than 1/10 with better hosting quality. Avoid GoDaddy, they are too Greedy."
"https://letsencrypt.org has been providing free SSL certificates for years, yet GoDaddy tries to charge $109.99 a year, trying to scam non-technical people. I have never requested anything to ""auto-renew"". Oh also I can't disable it because their website has technical issues. Avoid at all cost, I just moved everything away from those scammers."
"My domain registration lapsed as the email from GoDaddy to renew went to my junk folder.
Now, because I wanted to keep everything with another provider - I deactivated my domain name under godaddy's account page.
Well - little did I know that they were going to hold it active in their name - on the icann database - so that I'd have to pay them an extra $80usd redemption fee to release it!!!!
Really appalling tactics..."

"Domain Alliance, a search engine optimisation (seo) service, contacted me to promote their service three days after I built up my website through GoDaddy. I have paid them since they know all the details of my website, including my name, so I think they must know it from GoDaddy. However, I could not see any progress after paying the money.
I have been contacting them for refund, but of course no response.
I have contacted GoDaddy on the livechat, contentcomplaints@godaddy.com,
and udrpdisputes@godaddy.com. They kick the issue to each other and nobody gives a try to resolve it.
Now I have a big doubt on the quality of GoDaddy's customer service too. I won't renew the website with GoDaddy again."
Never again...scabs wouldn't refund my money even after I upgraded after speaking to them and taking their advise and it was still crap... would never recommend anyone to use them
Mum has had a website hosted by Go Daddy for the past 5 years. This week she received a renewal & they tried to put up the price she had originally paid by 500%. She managed to negotiate the price down. The call centre operator from Go Daddy advised because her site was 5 years old her website would need to move from an old platform to a new platform but that if she made payment it was a quick job & he would do it for her. She made payment then he never returned her call & other call centre operators she has since spoke with have told her sorry this would not be possible & she would need to rebuild her website from scratch. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
"Godaddy not only deserves NO STARS but it deserves investigating. It has the dodgiest business practices. After an enquiry into the banking industry, web services could be next. It's full of charletons and shysters and GoDaddy are one of the worst. Their business model is built around confusion, fear and dishonesty. After having been tricked into getting their WebBuilder+eCommerce package I discovered it had very little capability and wouldn't do what I wanted. The demo video had been carefully constructed to gloss over the inabilities.

was left with cPanel hosting. The SSL installation process was an absolute nightmare: complex, convoluted and no support. When I go through the Chat help, it involves over an hour of explaining at length what the problem is (with people who don't really understand English, and don't even try to suggest that's racist, because I have no idea what race they are. I only know that they don't (or pretend not to) understand English. They could be Australian for all I know.) The ""advice"" I have received from GoDaddy has been inconsistent (even between Customer Reps), and in most cases, just plain wrong. Most times I have worked out the issue for myself, using google search and logic. The customer service reps aren't listening to the problem, they're looking for a way to sell you something else. I feel for them, I really do, I'm sure that not EVERYONE at GoDaddy is trying to rip people off. Most people try to do the right thing but I'm sure the GoDaddy business model doesn't accommodate that. The management team at GoDaddy should be ashamed of themselves. I would think that for all their trickery and immoral efforts at pinching that extra buck out your pocket, they would be far better off having a sensible business model, backed by authentic customer service and building trust with the customer. The customer would GLADLY buy services from a company that can be trusted and that offers real support. GoDaddy is NOT that company. Go elsewhere."
GoDaddy are my go-to for domains as a developer. Amazing customer service over the phone and just bloody easy to work with. Been mucked around by other providers for domains but never had an issue with GoDaddy.
I have never experienced incompetence of this kind with any other business. It has taken over 2 weeks and 9 engagements with customer service staff simply to get domain updated.
"So a year ago I used their service for a couple months. I now no longer have an account with them no longer use their service but they still took $25 from me, charging me for another year and yet I no longer have an account or website with them. I cant even get my money back, such crap."
"- On sale strategy is pathetic. Everytime you ring, they want to sell you another ""essential"" service.
- Paid for backup. Turns out it never worked for years and tried to blame me as ""I should've known""
- Refund policies are terrible. Was advised at time of purchase that terms were ""pro rata"" and would be refunded for unused terms if terminating early. Turns out this wasn't true..."

g. Short version: servers of GoDaddy are NOT SECURED AND NOT PROTECTED, VERY OLD, NOT SECURED HARDWARE, which should be in the garbage! Nothing against Ddos attacks has been done. So all databases hosted on them got hacked, 28,000 clients have no access to their databases, not by php client, not by ftp, and many have their sites simply down!!!!
GoDaddy and ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group"" FELONY DISCLOSURE. Probably the feature POLICE case. Did you ever had this situation: you look for the domains for your company or for your client (and specially if you have a brand client with trademarks registered), and many times the domain is already taken, and GoDaddy propose you to pay 60$ to negotiate? Or you buy quiet expensive from ""private user"" domain in the auction? Yep, there's it is. And GoDaddy will never show who owns the domain of your client's brand. Many times you see this when you check for the owner in WHOIS other sources: ""Name Management Group, LLC (Nanci Nette), 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US"".
When you see this know that this ""Nanci Nette from Name Management Group"" is actually GoDaddy itself.
I'm going to lay down discovered facts. There's no such person as Nanci Nette, not a single social media profile. This so called ""Name Management Group, LLC"" simply doesn't exist in the California registry, and never existed (checked). And you can see the records of this Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC: this non-existing company owns about 45000 domains! And all of them only with GoDaddy!!! Address: 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US belongs to THE AVENUE - luxury apartments for rent. Yep!!!! All letters, including legal services (thousands of them) transferred to GoDaddy address, according to information provided by management of THE AVENUE.
And of course I strongly suggest you to Google ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" - you will see thousands lawsuits for ""domain squatting"". ""Domain squatting"" is ownership of the domains corresponding to brands names. For example I have company ""My Domain"", I own trademarks, I also have a domain ""mydomain.com"" and ""mydomain.net"", but I didn't purchase ""mydomain.org"" and ""mydomain.info"" or ""mydomain.co.uk"". Be sure that ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" / GoDaddy bought it and wants to sell them to you for very high price. And also check how all lawsuits are going. This ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" never responds to the complaint and judge orders to transfer the domain to the company who filed a complaint. GoDaddy does the transfer very quickly! Yep, all lawsuits go in this scenario! Little trick here though. Letting GoDaddy ""to negotiate"" the domain for you / or buying domain at the GoDaddy auction will be always less expensive than filing the lawsuit in WIPO or ICANN. Yep!!!!! GoDaddy FELONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

would recommend you never do business with this company. They use algorithms to follows searches, and when you find good domains they auto-buy it before you get a chance to check out.

"Dreadful company. Stole my money and refused to talk to me. 5 times i have asked to speak to a manager, and they have promised to call me back in 72 hours, and never did. They stole £47.95 from my credit card. (For services i never signed up for) I have already spent days on the phone pressing numbers and trying to get through to a manager. (All other staff say i need a manager) I have now given up, as i have spent more time then the money is worth. I have considered taking them to court.. but again its not worth the costs of taking them to court over £47.95. GoDaddy = Thieves. Simple as that. I&#039;m very unhappy, and they wont even talk to me. Im still waiting for you to call me GoDaddy.."
Smart line rocks
AVOID AT ALL COSTS GO TO WORDPRESS OR WIX etc!!! Absolutely the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with! Renewed my &quot;website builder&quot; without informing me that they were going to charge me £7.99 for an old version when the new version only costs £5.99. Not only that but when I came to renew this year they were unable to transfer my website from the &quot;old&quot; version to the &quot;new&quot; verison as they are not compatible and said I will need to start from scratch again. Customer service said that&#039;s just how it is and they are sorry about that. Of course I will not do that so will go elsewhere! There are many great website builders that only cost £2-3 so I highly recommend avoiding this pathetic service and using a better company. You will find it much cheaper too!!
Very nice and relevant support
There creams are good value the company are efficient well good packaging .
Social media advisor just kept sending a link that didn&#039;t deal with my issue and then started referring me to an online chat service that didn&#039;t work. I am now at the point of just being ignored. Absolutely terrible service.

GoDaddy have been totally amazing in providing me with help and assistance no matter what time I call. I highly recommend them.
They are just the best 
Blood suckers. I am a 5 year customer. Times are a bit tough right now. I have called in twice to renew my domain names and websites. When I told them I only wanted a &quot;month-to-month&quot; renewal the rep quickly became disinterested and tried his best to get me off the phone. I will not renew and will transfer all of my accounts. They seemed to have forgotten how they became a major player.

"Two weeks, 5 sites consistently down and Godaddy still ruins my life. One job lost, thousands of membership site clients unsubscribing and my partners wanting to kill me. This was not just one of the worst IT experiences I have had (after 8 years in the industry) but it was one of the worst experience of my life. Businesses lost, unimaginable stress and teams of workers sitting around for 2 weeks as they could not access the sites. In total I spent over 90 hours working on something that should be the most simple process ever - moving from one hosting to another. Wrong. To begin with they tell you to make a backup of your current hosting and upload it their server which can then unzip it and &#039;away you go&#039;. Well, it couldn&#039;t unzip it, 2.8GB is a super large file. So I had to download the file unzip, re upload the unzipped files and then the fun began. This is when wanting to kill myself and everyone at go daddy began. From a host of MySQL database errors, some they fixed, some they caused and all of which was &#039;outside of our current support&#039; but of course the sales staff say &#039;no worries we help guide you through all that&#039;. It&#039;s not simple with them, its not easy and they may even ask you to upgrade to a Cpanel system which means all your emails etc go back to the stone age. I hate you. Before that their 500MB of email space was only 500 accounts at 1mb each - bastards. There&#039;s another $100 given up for extra email space - not what sales tells you. Lies. The Music: What do you think would happen if they actually played depressing / not-upbeat music the whole time? People would be topping themselves. Finally I spoke to &#039;Phil&#039; - who, after spending an hour on the phone and helped me escalate my claim twice - one of my other sites on the server failed. FML . Thank god after a few biscuits and episodes of 24 they fixed what they broke. After now a total of $100 skype dollars of credit wasted they told me to begin it all again as they can&#039;t seem to fix the database for the primary domain or guide me on how to do it. Now, I do wish I was an American so I could go postal on their customer service department. Hear me guys - nothing, not even FREE hosting forever and ever is worth going with these guys. You know when you buy a ticket for a flight at a cheap price but after one piece of luggage and taxes the $60 flight is now $190? Well that&#039;s Godaddy on the web. So much has been lost in business, time and sanity with these guys. It took so long that my house-mate bet me he could learn all the countries in Africa before this problem was solved. http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/dec/20/geography-game-how-well-know-world He got it to 51/51. He beat me - and Bob Parsons I&#039;m gonna hire Jean Claude Van Dame from your stupid ads to come and sodomise you in the skull. I hate you go daddy. "

I lost the contents in 'subfolder B' and I ended up having fixed the links to over 1000 images. DO NOT trust their content migration service."
"I rang up to renew my domain name and it was canceled by the Consultant.

Then I was sold an SSL Certificate and NOT TOLD at time of purchase that I needed to get a Web Developer to code it onto my website. Therefore, I have paid for something that has been of ABSOLUTELY NO USE to me!

The Consultants are paid an incentive to sell you additional products and services. They induce you to buy products, without giving you all of the information you need in order to gain benefit from what you have purchased.

In other words my experience has been that they apply deceptive conduct to induce the purchase of products/services."
They allow people to join that make out there a huge company when in fact there one person. They allow there users to steal policy’s from other users. They allow domains to put up threats to customers. They allow users that don’t even own a company to make out there huge. When in fact there nothing .You waist your time making reports. As nothing gets done as promised
Pathetic service. They charged the CC as soon as you check-out but never received any email with instructions on installations. Their staff are very dodgy on the Chat Session. They just vanish without resolving the issue particularly the girl Lakshmi Soumya

"We signed a three year deal with Godaddy for web hosting which included hosting the website and email. After two years into the deal, they have contacted us and said they no linger wish to provide this sort of email service and are cancelling it. We are now required to pay them for access to our email. The base level of email service is around 50% of the original hosting cost. Do not believe that this company will honour their contracts."

"I wanted to change Godaddy to do my hosting and they promised they will guide me through the whole process but they let me down.
They sent me articles which were incorrect,I called them and they admitted to that and then they said to me now you need to do the second part of transfer of your file by yourself and this part is more difficult.The lady I spoke to was very rude so they sent me another instructions to do everything by myself.Before I paid my subscription they promised they will help me and basically now they wished me good luck.
Well Godaddy very horrible customer service experience!!!! You should be ashamed of it!!! I am very disappointed!!!"
Never go with Godaddy. They increase prices year by year. If you forgot to renew your domain or hosting it is a fortune for them. It starts from $250.00 onwards. Don't rely on them. keep a backup always. Better find another company for a piece of mind.
"Godaddy is a horrible choice for Australians planning to host their website. Here are some points on why they're bad:
-Clunky and slow interfaces, outdated technologies, frustratingly bad menu system: it's filled with menus on top of menus, the design could be so much simpler.
-Their nearest data center is in ASIA, meaning if you host with them your website is significantly SLOWER compared to an Australian hosted web service.
-Downright horrible service
-Outdated documentation, making troubleshooting issues using their documentation much harder
-Restrictive email relaying system
-SSL system filled with bugs and issues"

I didn't mind paying the money if I received the service and promptly but this was nowhere near the case with GD. I moved my sites away from GD cause I just gave up dealing with them and from 800 plus dollars with GD, I paid 150 with another company for three sites and with free SSL and the sites were migrated over in less than a day, not nearly a week as it was with GD.

"We lost out whole website due to their consultant incompetence. We have prolonged the expiring hosting Cpanel over the phone but the representative forgot/didnt do it right. Therefore, the services were canceleed and we lost the whole websote. Wanted to charge us 250 dollars for restoration even though it was their fault."
"I was called by one of the go daddy sales team telling me that the domains they were hosting for me were on old technology and needed to be upgraded. I was travelling loads at the time for work and agreed to the upgrade. The so called upgrade was very misleading as what they did was provide microsoft office 365 licences to all my family that we didnt need, didnt know we had nor did we use it. The bill came to $1400, it was charged to my Amex card and when i picked it up a few weeks later they refused to refund it.

These guys are so shonky. I cancelled my plan which had 2 weeks left until renewal. Straight after cancellation they denied me access to the FTP and I could not transfer files. Said I had to pay a an extra $150 to get data back.
"SSL was meant auto renew in October, was charged 2 months prior to the date. Had to cancel my service to get refund, lost 2 months of my prepaid service."
"I received a call from a salesman. Telling me that as my web server was not secure I should pay up to roll over onto a secure server.

This would be ok IF I didn’t have another 14 months on my current contract (paid up as a 5 year plan). PLUS the guy on the phone made me feel as if I didn’t take up the offer the cost would escalate next year. Ever felt like you’ve got a gun to your head GoDaddy?? Essentially they wanted me to pay up $450 now to “secure” my price and roll over early - thus they secure my business for another 5 years!

hat he sent me this information in an email. He did and it was so rude and unprofessional, with no explanation and no address to me. I was so concerned about my hosting tonight that I rang customer service to see if I could gain further clarification. Thank God the person I spoke to put my mind at ease and emphasised that I was under no obligation or pressure to take this offer - however, it was stressed to me that my current server was like an “old car”. Does this mean they sold me a sub standard product 5 years ago?? This sales tactic is LOW. I am a small business with limited means. When I paid my 5 years in good faith I did not expect to receive a hard sales pitch 14 months out from the end of my time."
I have tried 15 times to get godaddy to fus my SSL issues. Why am I paying them over $600 a year for services and $300 for SSL. So incompetent
"I received a call from Godaddy saying that I needed to change hostings within their company because the old version was going to e deleted, which then I agreed to pay for the new hosting and requested for the old one to be removed, nevertheless, they never removed the old hosting and instead charged as their product is setup to have auto renewals. In addition, I was charged for an autorenewal for an email product that was given me for free and I was never informed about that product.

Be very aware of what they really sell you."
Not a bad place if you want basic hosting. It is relatively reliable and the support is (eventually) there. Also it is an old player in the field and unlikely to close up shop any time soon.

Support is quite normal, though, in the first case I managed solve the problem myself, and in the second case they were trying to be helpful, though I was speaking to customer support not the technical people who were actually working on the problem. GoDaddy has recently introduces a quite useful Worldpress hosting package, which works well. But they have been often twicking it, which was causing some delays and off times, though not quite often. In overall I recommend GoDaddy, although if reliability factor is crucial for your website you might want to look somewhere else.

"Dear Go Daddy thank you so much for your Monday motivation. And absolutely, the journey must first begin, only thing is your service is a complete contradiction to the marketing messages you are “selling” to the hard working business owners and consumers here in Australia.
Well because you asked what steps we took to turn our entrepreneurial idea into reality we thought it was only fair to answer - here we go:
We have spent over one thousand hours and we have spent over $6,000 dollars to not even complete one step with Go Daddy.
Our small but ... Read more

awesome business sought out your services over 4 months ago as we were expanding ( yay this is meant to be something to celebrate) and wow what a humble beginning you have offered us. Where does one begin when they have so many encounters? Ok well, let’s see we migrated our account across, couldn’t send emails for about 1 month, had our account hacked despite us having Azure set up and 2 point authentication - We were advised by one of your team members not to worry its just malware! ( oh ok Malware bots are so friendly said no-one ever) After several fruitless hours/ calls to your dedicated support team, we finally made an inroad and it was admitted to us that the issues were experiencing were due to the fact that the security had been removed by one of your team members, who was just so excited to sell us the latest Wordpress package, and they believed in the product so much that they felt it was ok to completely compromise their customers accounts to make a sale. ( are you serious ) Your staff must be on KPIs as this is just B/S. We then escalated this to Microsoft premium 365 who will be in touch with you soon due to your mismanagement. We have had to make daily calls that went for at least 1 hour and some days there were several. To the point, we lost 2 jobs due to we couldn’t quote/go to meetings as we were in damage control mode dealing with your lack of dealing. Our CPanel ( which we only moved due to the great advice of your caring and helpful staff stating it would streamline our business and cope with the number of sites we build) We were also advised to do so as your server was so slow to load it was taking twice the time to run our business. Well, anyway the CPANEL was also hacked by malware bots and there goes 6 months of work! There was no support from your team or even the slightest genuine motivation to help remedy this. And Go, Daddy, If you send me a message ill give you our account number and you will see the hours and hours of calls notes blah blah blah."
Just purchase an SSL certificate and my website is not hosted with go daddy they cannot help me install it and it has been over 30 days so they won't refund BUT when I purchase it DID NOT said anything about that! Very poor consumer service.
"Sold me a hosting package that was incompatible with the platform i was using, then locked me out of cpanel, for two months rendering it useless, had to move to another provider costing thousands due to being locked out, finally got moved over then then godaddy said they would not refund me any of the money I paid for hosting I can not use."
"We have a WordPress website that is hosted with GoDaddy Managed Wordpress service. In our plan, we have an allowance for two websites. each website has a staging website.
The plan was to use one website as dev\test and the other one as a staging production. so we will do dev -> test -> staging - > prod. and we were happy to buy the managed WordPress plan because we didn't want all the headache around the WordPress admin. BUT THE SAD REALITY IS:
1. I will start with the interaction with them:
a. Every time you call Godday you are expected to s... Read more

pend at least 17 - 30 minutes until someone picks up the phone. b. every time speak with someone, you need to tell your story again and again - they seem to ignore all the notes that other tiers noted, even if it was in the same conversation. c. they don't return call you back if the call disconnected and you need to call again (it's a bit frustrating when on the phone with them 60 min - 90 min) and obviously you need to wait again, tell the story again and so on... 2. You can't push from one website to another website - that means we need to do the development, testing and staging on the staging web site. 3. The admin doesn't allow you to restore the staging website from backup, that means any issue in the development you need to call them and this is painful (Point #1) 4. Pushing the Staging to the production in our case failed, so we had to have manually pushed by the backend team, this had to be done 5 times and every time they say the process can take up to 1 hour so if you still have an issue then call us again (point #1-5 again). 5. during the attempts to push manually the Staging to the production they screwed the staging also, so for two days we didn't know what is going with all our work."
"Wow - didn't think this could happen, paid for everything spent a heap of time getting my domain, building my website, paying for additional emails, setting them up THEN get an automated response saying to prove my credit card is mine. Uploaded my license which has my abbreviated name i.e. Chris vs Christos. They cancelled my site Did not respond to my emails only via automated agents. Lost my domain, lost my email, lost my images, lost all my work and not even a hint of support."
"Getting started with Godaddy was very easy and quite inexpensive. But over the following year as the introductory period ended it became quite expensive. When I tried to cut back on some of my products my attempts were reversed on their web site. After much frustrating discussion with their Support team I was convinced that I had to set up Two-Step Verification so I could securely cancel my products and stop the auto renew charges. I did that and cancelled all my auto-renewals. During the past month I have been inundated with emails about my au... Read more

to-renewals because somehow one of them has been turned back on. To turn it off I have to log in using the Two-Step Verification but the phone number for the 2nd step code has been changed to one that isn't mine. So I can't log in and their Support team say they can't either. They require me to email them a copy of photo ID with my face clearly shown, my signature, date of birth and so on before they will assist me. This is a huge security risk from a company who can't prevent my phone number from being changed on my ""secure"" account and I won't do it. So they intend to continue auto-renewing my account indefinitely. The only way to prevent them is to cancel my credit card. What a hassle!!"
"I have now finally cancelled all my Hosting services and SSL certificates on GoDaddy. I am running 2 VPS servers on Linode for the same cost ($25/month paid by the hour) as my one GoDaddy shared hosting! (I have not looked back - to get the same VPS on Godaddy would cost $41.98/month paid by the month if you can figure out how to turn off all the extras!)

I don't know how many people there are per server but it must be a lot. - The 'Unlimited' features are a long way from Unlimited. In fact they are the very opposite! - The script timeouts seem to also apply to their own website. Trying to download my data took a very long time. With frequent drop outs. - The MySql server is slow and drops out. Trying to download large databases is very difficult!"
"Obscure interface with hidden billing path. Hard to find how to cancel a product.
When you find it, you may get one of these meaningless messages
""Don't worry, we won't take it personal:This product cannot be canceled at this time. Please contact our customer service team for more information.""
So you have to call them to sort out the issue when it should take a single click. I am closing my account once and for all."
"They are not an Australian company. They use Australian phone no.s but do not have a local presence in Australia. GoDaddy is the worst business experience we have ever had.

However, without any notification via email, text or phone, GoDaddy deleted our corporate website that runs an educational program because we were late for a m... Read more

onthly payment of $10! It was after a few days we found out. We have been their customer for years, yet we could not reason out with them. Please refer to the links below, and understand how dangerously deceptive, and ruthless, this company and its staff members are. Thousands of customers have had heavy losses because GoDaddy's business practices are one sided. Customer care is not in their radar. When I finally managed to get a hold of them, GoDaddy said they sent us three ""failed billing notices"" to our email before taking our website away. Firstly, no, we haven't had any such GoDaddy ""failed billing notices"" in our email, not even in our spam folder. And, yes, we do have three Domain Notifications for a domain we cancelled a long time ago, which has nothing to do with our website. Secondly, I learnt from GoDaddy staff yesterday, that they send these ""failed billing notices"" to existing customers from their marketing department and not from the billing department just so that these notices go to customers' spam folder so they will not know that their websites would be deleted and then GoDaddy demands a restoration fee of $250 under threat of destroying the website information. I allege this to be extortion. We respectfully asked them to do what's right by us. Most of their staff members are sadistic, and get a sick satisfaction when customers call in a panic after seeing their website disappeared. I had to research for hours to get their USA phone no.s and read reviews on USA Better Business Bureau. I then spent hours to get a hold of their staff just to gather what their practices are and why they would do such a bizarre thing. The first two put me on hold saying they were transferring me to a supervisor, and after half an hour or so I hung up realising they were dishonest and wanted me to tire of holding. The third person was mocking at me that it was their right to take our website because we didn't pay. The fourth person insisted, talking over me constantly, that they sent out notices even though I said we haven't received any. He condescendingly demanded that I deal with Gmail if the notices were in my Spam folder. The fifth person from billing dept said that so many customers have had my experience. I asked her, even though we haven't had any GoDaddy email notices sent to us, if it was the billing department that send out these ""failed billing notices"" they refer to, and she said no, it was the Marketing Department. She then said GMail is not good and that we should buy their product for email as its better than GMail and that their notices would not have gone to Spam folder if we had their product! She even discussed the cost of their email product with me. I persevered so I could get to the bottom of this scam for the sake of all Australian consumers. Please, fellow Australians, avoid them like the plague before you lose your precious website that is worth thousands of $$$$ and your good reputation, for the inadvertent delay of payment of a $10 subscription. Go to Singaporean companies. Very ethical, and legally safe: https://www.bbb.org/…/godaddycom-llc-1126-22000…/complaints… https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.godaddy.com"
I registered a business name with Australia Government which I took photo of time and that the fact that the domain.com was available. I then visited your website and typed it in to buy it for .99 cents only to be forced to call you to be advised it was just bought five minutes ago!! Instead of 99 cents it would be $112 but because it was listed for sale go daddy are sure they could secure it for me. outraged. scam. asked for management - tried again had when called back and have been blocked. no where to send complaints on your website. this is an outrage
"Hi we are a corporate client with over ten established websites
Go Daddy took our money to back up our sites, but failed to make the back ups
Subsequently 2 of our sites went down and the back ups could not be reinstated for obvious reasons.

I discovered they have no local Australian Premises and operate our of Arizona.

GoDaddy admitted liability to me and offered me free hosting for three years as compensation but the sites will cost us about $8000 to recreate

Despite having a team of developers (they did not offer to rebuild the sites at their cost

Beware of this organisation as in my view it has no ethics and does not act honourably when confronted with an error on its part"
"What happened to GoDaddy? Customer service was excellent. Now it’s extremely poor. GoDaddy demanded a copy of a government issued ID to “verify credit card details” but not one of their policies stipulates how that information would be safeguarded, and how they would anonymise any information post verification. Two emails written in simple English were dismissed by the “customer service” representative. A request for a senior customer service manager to contact me was ignored. A formal complaint was lodged with the Bureau of Consumer Protection. Once my current hosting expires, I’m taking my business elsewhere."
"They provide poor service. Can't contact them, over 30 minutes on hold. Gave up. No matter how many times I cancelled the auto renewal payment, they keep stealing my money. It took way too much pain to cancel their service for it to not be intentional. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
I made a typo while trying to visit facebook and ended up on a Fake Virus page that said I have a virus and need to call a number to get it fixed. I did a whois search and found that was a godadddy domain. I reported this to godaddy and they still haven't removed it (it's been 3 days since I reported it). As I was visiting a page that they have control over I feel that I'm a customer and have written this review of their service (or lack of).

bdomain because sometimes the IO processes exceeds and the other time ""the server closed the connection"" error. I talked with their support team and they said to upgrade the resources level to get more power. I said, fine, let's see.
Now after two years I upgraded my hosting plan to delux and still get the same 512 RAM which is not even enough for 100 - 200 visitors per day. I kind of debated with them for what's the logic in up-gradation if I get the same resource level. But the executive (girl) was quite dumb and could not justify and ended up saying that they have the same resource level setup for all the plans. Frankly speaking they charge almost the same amount as the hosting fee (one year) for resource level up-gradation which is not logical and feasible. The only benefit they show case is the number of emails they provide with each plans. Not every body require 500 emails, I mean what am I supposed to do with 500 and 1000 emails if I do not get bandwidth / physical memory upgraded with the respective plans.
The most vague thing is they never talk about resources prior to sales. Huh! I will certainly move to other good hosts out there where I get value for money.

Good One Nice Website
I'm finding it all easy enough to get everything going there at GoDaddy
Great experience with GoDaddy! Easy to sign up and register your domain+ free and good subscription options for website setup and ext.
This was a great service over the phone as I had let my service expire for my domain name - they talked me through how to reboot the serve
Great Thank You
Just getting started but I love the ease in using and think it's going to be great!
No/limited tool-tips on the sign-up page for a domain name while some data entry fields are not clear on the requirements resulting in either having to 'guess' what is required or contact support.
excellent so far.
The girl was very patient and extremely helpful And knowledgeable
Excellent service and product.
"Easy to use and great product output.  Less than complete, overall understanding presented of how my ownership of my domain could work in the future outside of GoDaddy's own website hosting, but fair game considering you're just going to try and keep me locked on your quality-functioning-for-now teet of a website."
Great Job! I May Promote You

"AFTER CANCELING MY WEBSITE SUBSCRIPTION, GODADDY KEPT DEBETING MY CREDIT CARD FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS!!
SCAMMERS!!!"
Overnight they did something to cause a complete change in how to get into my email account.  I could not access my email account.  Called several times and they had no clue what they did or how to fix it.  Went a week without getting into my emails.  Still can&#039;t.  I cannot believe they create a problem and then can&#039;t solve it.  Too bad they don&#039;t know the words &quot;customer service.&quot;
Smart line rocks
"Wanted to upgrade my account and had a few clarification inquiries. It me one hour with customer service and still had no response. I think the person must have engaged several other people to answer simple questions which made it ridiculously lengthy and half the time the answers I got did not make sense.

Sorry GoDaddy, not the support I was hoping to find!"
"GoDaddy has to be the worst company to work with. It has taken us 15 days to transfer a domain and it still hasn&#039;t happened yet. Nobody should work with GoDaddy. You are warned.

I was on chat and calls so many times. Our tech team was on it so many times. but there is always something else they tell you. Basically they block it in the backend stopping you from transferring your domain."
"Made a site on there a few days ago just to try it out, and while it feels smoother than Wix, it&#039;s too restrictive in editing. Even the box through which you edit the site is tiny and feels suffocating. Wish there were more editing options."
"They slowed our site to try and sell a new $4,300 server sollution! We moved to AWS for $3.50 month. Site was not the cause of slow response. GD did it! 
If your site has a 20 second lag you are losing visitors!"
"I have been using GoDaddy for the last 5 years. I haven&#039;t had any problems with them. Good promotions let you buy domains at a good price. Easy to buy, easy to use. I like it."
"If you are after a quality service (with quality customer service), your best option is NameCheap. GoDaddy is outrageously bad at managing any customer issues. Their products simply do not work and they are always unwilling to provide you with a refund for non-working products.

They took the liberty to create a non-working email address for a domain that they don&#039;t manage (Unbelievable!). If the domain is not under their management it is impossible to have a working email address... Godaddy does not seem to understand that...

They also don&#039;t understand that, under the Fair Trade Act, they are obliged to address non-working products after their BS 30-day money back guarantee.

With NameCheap they keep your domain private for FREE and the domains and hosting plans are way cheaper than GoDaddy. They are super fast at responding to your requests and fix problems straight away. I am very glad that I&#039;ve found a great alternative to this shambles of a company."
"There is no option in Godaddy&#039;s website to file a complaint which is the usual thing companies do to encourange communication and feedback between the company and their clients.

I have been using Godaddy for years and I feel totally cheated. Since users can&#039;t write nor chat to obtain support and users can just call, I have been &#039;helped&#039; by call agents. Those have given me wrong advise I see now that I have been paying as if I were a company with 25-30 websites when I just am a normal simple home user with one website.
I don&#039;t have much money but now I am stuck with paying 50 euros per month for services I have never and will never use. I have been totally cheated by Godaddy. I have never felt this way with anohter company. I have lost at last 2000 euros, but it feels worse. I feel I have ben cheated 2000 euros.

It seems the call agents work on commission and they have just sold me anything that was good for them and not for me. I insist, it&#039;s very hard for me to pay that money and I am not even using it. I am leaving Godaddy as soon as possible.

I want to ask a refund for having been mislead with information about hosting services I never needed.

It&#039;s very horrible that Godaddy behaves this way."
"The site is amazing ,the language is quite easy to read an navigate.Anyone would easily understand the language."
Godaddy made me buy the wrong product 3 times and they decline to refund me. every time I call or email them they tell me that they&#039;ll get back to me but they won&#039;t.
"You are still keeping your intellectual property - domains and sites assets with GoDaddy? YOU ARE DEAD!!!!!!!!!!! Run for your life if you still can!!!!
Here are the reasons. First of all they treat their clients like dirt. Having bunch of sweet sugar-candy youngsters to answer you on a phone is not a &quot;providing service&quot;. We left this company 7 months ago, after absolutely unspeakable incident - they blocked our web-site, known media source with 1 million readers... just because they can, and because I&#039;m an idiot - I made a decision to host our media with them in the first place. And now we live happily ever after with another hosting provider, very well, and secure, and specially me, as I&#039;m the one who&#039;s responsible for all web development in our company. We paid about 2000$ a year to GoDaddy. Who cares, right? GoDaddy happily participate in all unfair competition actions and felonies organized in USA, and block European commpanies during the time of the high sales. For the last 2 years GoDaddy lost millions of their clients, including shareholders. Check their stock....
Second of all - prices: GoDaddy make you feel that their services are cheap. Oh no!!!!! You actually pay very high price for domains - you can get them much cheaper with another provider and you don&#039;t need to be in their domain club - that&#039;s how they collect TVA taxes back if you are buying on behalf of the company and have your taxes reduced. Today for the same number of the domains and super hosting plans, private servers, protected against Ddos attacks, CDN etc (much higher than we had at GoDaddy) we pay alsmost hald price. In total we save about 500$ a year. 
So and the third reason - QUALITY!
GoDaddy propose to you all kind of hostings, private servers etc.... all of these are VERY OLD, NOT SECURED  HARDWARE, which should be in the garbage. Recently May 4th, 2020 sites, 28,000 hosted with GoDaddy sites GOT HACKED!!!!!!!! Wordfence developers (known security plugin) received this information and publicly announced it. Details see on their blog. Short version: servers of GoDaddy are NOT SECURED AND NOT PROTECTED! Nothing against Ddos attacks has been done. I remember how many times our web-site was down because of that when we hosted it with GoDaddy. Our company had massive financial damages...... GoDaddy selling you place on very old server, no security, no nothing, nada, for very high price. So all databases hosted on them got hacked, 28,000 clients have no access to their databases, not by php client, not by ftp, and many have their sites simply down!!!! Congratulations!!!!!! There you go, GoDaddy, results are very well deserved!!!!! I personally glad they got it, and I also hope that poor clients who got hacked will file massive lawsuit against GoDaddy, and demand financial damages for their hacked web-sites.
And!!!!!! GoDaddy and &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group&quot; FELONY DISCLOSURE. Probably the feature POLICE case. Did you ever had this situation: you look for the domains for your company or for your client (and specially if you have a brand client with trademarks registered), and many times the domain is already taken, and GoDaddy propose you to pay 60$ to negotiate? Or you buy quiet expensive from &quot;private user&quot; domain in the auction? Yep, there&#039;s it is. And GoDaddy will never show who owns the domain of your client&#039;s brand. Many times you see this when you check for the owner in WHOIS other sources: &quot;Name Management Group, LLC (Nanci Nette), 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US&quot;. 
When you see this know that this &quot;Nanci Nette from Name Management Group&quot; is actually GoDaddy itself. 
I&#039;m going to lay down discovered facts. There&#039;s no such person as Nanci Nette, not a single social media profile. This so called &quot;Name Management Group, LLC&quot; simply doesn&#039;t exist in the California registry, and never existed (checked). And you can see the records of this Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC: this non-existing company owns about 45000 domains! And all of them only with GoDaddy!!! Address: 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US belongs to THE AVENUE - luxury apartments for rent. Yep!!!! All letters, including legal services (thousands of them) transferred to GoDaddy address, according to information provided by management of THE AVENUE. 
And of course I strongly suggest you to Google &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; - you will see thousands lawsuits for &quot;domain squatting&quot;. &quot;Domain squatting&quot; is ownership of the domains corresponding to brands names. For example I have company &quot;My Domain&quot;, I own trademarks, I also have a domain &quot;mydomain.com&quot; and &quot;mydomain.net&quot;, but I didn&#039;t purchase &quot;mydomain.org&quot; and &quot;mydomain.info&quot; or &quot;mydomain.co.uk&quot;. Be sure that &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; / GoDaddy bought it and wants to sell them to you for very high price. And also check how all lawsuits are going. This &quot;Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC&quot; never responds to the complaint and judge orders to transfer the domain to the company who filed a complaint. GoDaddy does the transfer very quickly! Yep, all lawsuits go in this scenario! Little trick here though. Letting GoDaddy &quot;to negotiate&quot; the domain for you / or buying domain at the GoDaddy auction will be always less expensive than filing the lawsuit in WIPO or ICANN. Yep!!!!! GoDaddy FELONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Customer Support is excellent!
Amazing experience using their services for the first time. 
5 stars FOR SURE!"
"If there was a zero star, I would allocate this!!!! Started to deal with GoDaddy in early 2009 when I had an online company and found their front line support team were AMAZING, HELPFUL, POLITE &amp; RESPECTFUL. But that&#039;s where it ends, I have just wasted 15 hours on the phone to them, on 3 occasions a supervisor was supposed to call me and NEVER called - I finally sat on hold today for an hour waiting and actually spoke to a Floor Supervisor called Marcos, so they are actually real!!! Only to be told, too bad, it&#039;s your problem, we can&#039;t help you - regardless that it was the GoDaddy staff who created the problem..... cannot believe a company can treat a customer of 11 years like this.

I purchased my domain name for email purposes in August 2014 through GoDaddy and this all ran through my Personal Microsoft account which has my Microsoft Office 365 subscription. Through my Outlook app I ran both my personal email and business email.

In August 2018 I received my GoDaddy Domain renewal and the costs were 2.5 times more expensive than when I had set up the whole thing with them in 2014. I called the support crew and spoke with someone there and asked why were the costs so high? He stated he could put me on a cheaper program which was email only (as I didn&#039;t need an actual website) however it would mean I may lose some data. I told I needed to keep the costs as low as possible so we went ahead  at no time did he mention he would need to create a 2nd Microsoft Account and have it listed as a Business Plan Account.

In early March 2020 I had issues of my Outlook always asking for my email password and I called their centre at least 4 times and reset the password, tried security on the account nothing stopped the password locking  they advised me there was another device trying to log in with an old password. This could not be as I had signed out of my old devices and did a factory reset before disposing of them.

Last Sunday March 22, 2020 we finally worked out that I had 2 Microsoft accounts .... I was then advised that the business Online Plan 1 Account did not allow for me to use the Outlook app as it was not included in the subscription. They then advised I needed to speak with Microsoft and request for the two accounts to be merged .... see via separate email a copy of the log from when I contacted Microsoft who explained me the situation that the two accounts are on different servers and could not be merged but maybe Outlook.com could offer me a solution. I REALLY do not want to change my email address again and I need the data from my Exchange account such as emails, contacts, calendar etc.

GoDaddy have basically thrown me under the bus, I am now stuck with having to do the following:
Run my Work Email with no contacts or calendar through the Office 365 Outlook app AND my personal exchange email account through the standard windows 10 Mail app for PC which contains all of my personal &amp; work contacts plus my calendar, again personal &amp; work all in one place"
Haven&#039;t much to say. Really happy about your service guys! Use it for my online store and definitely recommend to all
"Do Not go to go daddy they have continued to charge my credit card for three months after i canceled.
If you talk to Julian&lt; who is supposed  to be in charge of cancellations, Do not belive a word he SAYS!!!!,
STAY AWAY FROM GO DADDY"
I am their client for almost 2 years but every time I need support they are not available fast. I have to wait for a long time.
"So, to update my last review from 3/31/2019, a lady by the name of Jenny asked on April 2nd that I reach out to her.  I have sent 2 emails, and still haven&#039;t heard from her. I am now not able to get my accounting reports for taxes unless I pay them $60. Fortunately, Shopify is assisting businesses by offering 90 days for free so I am rebuilding my website. Customers have rallied around me and various business owners in Facebook groups have been supportive in offering help which I do not need at the time. But it just goes to show, the old saying &quot;Real friends are the ones running in when everyone else is running out&quot; can apply to businesses as well.

"I&#039;ve been a Godaddy customer for over a decade. Recently, the company has been changing fast and adopting certain predatory behaviors. On November the 4th, 2019, I received a notice that my domain expired on October the 31st because of an &quot;invalid or expired credit card&quot;. That was a surprise since all my other domains were being auto-renewed regularly. Also, I received no notice about any attempt to charge said invalid payment method. I checked my account and indeed, the Capital One card that was subject to leak by the company and exposed me to fraud and theft was there. However, there were three other payment methods (debit and credit cards), all valid. There is a reason a customer provides several payment methods when the company allows (and encourages) this: when something happens to one, the company charges the next. That&#039;s not what Godaddy did: they cancelled my domain but they offered to retrieve it from the &quot;parked nameservers&quot; for a $80 fee. In my understanding, this is extorsion. Apparently, they agree with me (that this is an illegal practice) since I called them the following day, I was very clear that they would be reported in case they refused to fix the situation and indeed they fixed it immediately. On November 10, 2019, again I received an email from Godaddy about an expired product due to &quot;invalid or expired payment method&quot;. Now they have no reason to claim that since I deleted all the other cards, leaving only my one very valid debit card on file. This is another attempt from Godaddy to inflict small damages, with small irregularities that their customer service agents are completely unsuccessful in fixing. The last one dropped the line (accidentally?) and the next one came asking for the same information. Keeping me all that time online creates a debt from Godaddy to me. I will bill them for that because there are too many red flags that this was a malicious action. Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#039;t. Let Godaddy choose which it is: if they pay, showing willingness to meet their damaged customers half-way, then they look good. Otherwise, they strengthen my hypothesis."
"They sound inexpensive at first. They are not! they are ridiculously expensive. Just wait for an auto-renewal, they will sneak in a nice price hike &quot;after your promotion ended&quot;.

Terrible business model!

They charged me an &quot;auto-renewal&quot;, and since I wasn&#039;t expecting it, I didn&#039;t check my business credit card account. I found out when I got the late fee notification by mail from the credit card company.

At times like this, that amazon AWS charges cents for hosting ... this guys at GoDaddy auto-charged me over $600 dollars for &quot;shared hosting&quot; (your site in the same server along with hundred others competing for resources)

Called customer service. They just made me laugh: 
- they couldn&#039;t refund me because 30 days had passed. Of course! I didn&#039;t know they had charged me.
- the rep: named Landon (didn&#039;t want to provide last name) literally said: since you already (forcibly) paid for it, you might as well use it.

Just save yourself some headache. Stay away from this clown business."
Good for domain and basic services like hosting. Customer service is good if you are lucky and get a US based agent.

"Hi guys, I have to say my experience moving all my business over to GoDaddy was just perfect. I was speaking to Nicholas (one of the GoDaddy guides) and he spent a good hour going through the process, costs and setup involved. He made sure to clarify all the different costs and procedures, even going the extra steps to setup my DNS redirections and IP addresses. 

Seriously I never reply to these but he was awesome, and deserves a huge thankyou from me.

Easy to do business with Go Daddy
"I had a really bad experience with the refund system of Godaddy. I requested a refund for a domain and they approved it through the phone and told me the money will come back in my account soon. I then waited a couple days and nothing came, I called again and I was told it will come in 30 days - after 30 days nothing came so i called again and they said it will take ANOTHER 3 working days for it to clear into my account, after 3 days NOTHING came -- then I kept calling day after day for my refund and they kept giving me different excuses as to why my money hasn't come. One of the advisors said this another said that and it just looked like I was either being lied to or there was a high level of disorganization within the company."
"I found the easiest part of building my own website was paying the fees, everything else was complicated."
"My tech adviser was Goran. He was outstanding at assisting me and made what appears a taunting task easy! Starting my own company is one of the most exciting things but Goran’s patience, expert knowledge and superior tech ability this would not have been possible. He suggested so many things and provided clear guidance and leadership on what I should do. I’m really grateful for his help and look forward to working with Go Daddy again."
Had issues completing sale via website but over the phone was real easy.
"Thank you for your help and your time, it was very helpful!"
"I’ve been using Go Daddy for years of pretending to start businesses.  This one may work.  Effortless infrastructure, easy to get what I need.

GoDaddy provide services to scammers such as quotenix
The options given to create a website is helpful.  My only challenge was not being able to adjust the font.
They rely on Office 365 which is absolutely horrible software. It totally messes up your email directory structure that you have built up over the years. Their 7/24 help is never available and always pushes you onto some really badly designed Bots. Finally you can never get a simple answer from their FAQs. All I wanted to do is to get the data on HOW MUCH STORAGE I was using on my Inbox FFS !!! Can't find it anywhere.
Great customer service. Maybe best customer service of any company I’ve experienced. CONSISTENTLY.
Very good support.
No help. In fact charged $96.00 for nothing. I told the guy I do not help. I want to do myself. It is a rip-off.
"After hosting my domain name and email for a decade, with quite a few gliches, I must admit, one day they completely lost all my info and stopped sending my mail. They said I did not have an account, even though they frequently sent me ads and even kind of tricked me into buying services I did not need. I truly hate them and would suggest no one use them."
GoDaddy has an excellent 24--hour support professionals. I built my website successfully without prior experience.  The site looks great! Many of my friends called me an expert. Thanks to GoDaddy.

It's been 72 hours now and I can not get through tech support. The wait is infinite. I finally waited until past midnight to call, now to my surprise it seems that they have a ""technical glitch"" that prevents then from routing my call (A.K.A. they seem to have stopped 24 x 7 support.
Since there is no plausible, or legal reasons for them to be blocking my domain transfer, I will have to escalate to the management chain of command or get legal. Anybody knows a good Lawyer? At this point, after been a loyal client for 20 years, it's unlikely that I will continue to do business with them. I will transfer all my business elsewhere. They are very shaddy indeed.

WORST. they took double money from previous year and also without informing me
"Dreadful company. Stole my money and refused to talk to me. 5 times i have asked to speak to a manager, and they have promised to call me back in 72 hours, and never did. They stole £47.95 from my credit card. (For services i never signed up for) I have already spent days on the phone pressing numbers and trying to get through to a manager. (All other staff say i need a manager) I have now given up, as i have spent more time then the money is worth. I have considered taking them to court.. but again its not worth the costs of taking them to court over £47.95. GoDaddy = Thieves. Simple as that. I&#039;m very unhappy, and they wont even talk to me. Im still waiting for you to call me GoDaddy.."

"You all already know that recently May 4th, 2020 sites, 28,000 hosted with GoDaddy sites GOT HACKED!!!!!!!! Wordfence developers (known security plugin) received this information and publicly announced it. Details see on their blo... Read More
g. Short version: servers of GoDaddy are NOT SECURED AND NOT PROTECTED, VERY OLD, NOT SECURED HARDWARE, which should be in the garbage! Nothing against Ddos attacks has been done. So all databases hosted on them got hacked, 28,000 clients have no access to their databases, not by php client, not by ftp, and many have their sites simply down!!!!
GoDaddy and ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group"" FELONY DISCLOSURE. Probably the feature POLICE case. Did you ever had this situation: you look for the domains for your company or for your client (and specially if you have a brand client with trademarks registered), and many times the domain is already taken, and GoDaddy propose you to pay 60$ to negotiate? Or you buy quiet expensive from ""private user"" domain in the auction? Yep, there's it is. And GoDaddy will never show who owns the domain of your client's brand. Many times you see this when you check for the owner in WHOIS other sources: ""Name Management Group, LLC (Nanci Nette), 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US"".
When you see this know that this ""Nanci Nette from Name Management Group"" is actually GoDaddy itself.
I'm going to lay down discovered facts. There's no such person as Nanci Nette, not a single social media profile. This so called ""Name Management Group, LLC"" simply doesn't exist in the California registry, and never existed (checked). And you can see the records of this Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC: this non-existing company owns about 45000 domains! And all of them only with GoDaddy!!! Address: 1619 NORTH LA BREA AVE, HOLLYWOOD CA, 90028, US belongs to THE AVENUE - luxury apartments for rent. Yep!!!! All letters, including legal services (thousands of them) transferred to GoDaddy address, according to information provided by management of THE AVENUE.
And of course I strongly suggest you to Google ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" - you will see thousands lawsuits for ""domain squatting"". ""Domain squatting"" is ownership of the domains corresponding to brands names. For example I have company ""My Domain"", I own trademarks, I also have a domain ""mydomain.com"" and ""mydomain.net"", but I didn't purchase ""mydomain.org"" and ""mydomain.info"" or ""mydomain.co.uk"". Be sure that ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" / GoDaddy bought it and wants to sell them to you for very high price. And also check how all lawsuits are going. This ""Nanci Nette, Name Management Group, LLC"" never responds to the complaint and judge orders to transfer the domain to the company who filed a complaint. GoDaddy does the transfer very quickly! Yep, all lawsuits go in this scenario! Little trick here though. Letting GoDaddy ""to negotiate"" the domain for you / or buying domain at the GoDaddy auction will be always less expensive than filing the lawsuit in WIPO or ICANN. Yep!!!!! GoDaddy FELONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AVOID AT ALL COSTS GO TO WORDPRESS OR WIX etc!!! Absolutely the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with! Renewed my &quot;website builder&quot; without informing me that they were going to charge me £7.99 for an old version when the new version only costs £5.99. Not only that but when I came to renew this year they were unable to transfer my website from the &quot;old&quot; version to the &quot;new&quot; verison as they are not compatible and said I will need to start from scratch again. Customer service said that&#039;s just how it is and they are sorry about that. Of course I will not do that so will go elsewhere! There are many great website builders that only cost £2-3 so I highly recommend avoiding this pathetic service and using a better company. You will find it much cheaper too!!
Very nice and relevant support
There creams are good value the company are efficient well good packaging .
Social media advisor just kept sending a link that didn&#039;t deal with my issue and then started referring me to an online chat service that didn&#039;t work. I am now at the point of just being ignored. Absolutely terrible service.

GoDaddy have been totally amazing in providing me with help and assistance no matter what time I call. I highly recommend them.
They are just the best 
Blood suckers. I am a 5 year customer. Times are a bit tough right now. I have called in twice to renew my domain names and websites. When I told them I only wanted a &quot;month-to-month&quot; renewal the rep quickly became disinterested and tried his best to get me off the phone. I will not renew and will transfer all of my accounts. They seemed to have forgotten how they became a major player. 
Thanks for the great &amp; helpful service GoDaddy!
"Two weeks, 5 sites consistently down and Godaddy still ruins my life. One job lost, thousands of membership site clients unsubscribing and my partners wanting to kill me. This was not just one of the worst IT experiences I have had (after 8 years in the industry) but it was one of the worst experience of my life. Businesses lost, unimaginable stress and teams of workers sitting around for 2 weeks as they could not access the sites. In total I spent over 90 hours working on something that should be the most simple process ever - moving from one hosting to another. Wrong. To begin with they tell you to make a backup of your current hosting and upload it their server which can then unzip it and &#039;away you go&#039;. Well, it couldn&#039;t unzip it, 2.8GB is a super large file. So I had to download the file unzip, re upload the unzipped files and then the fun began. This is when wanting to kill myself and everyone at go daddy began. From a host of MySQL database errors, some they fixed, some they caused and all of which was &#039;outside of our current support&#039; but of course the sales staff say &#039;no worries we help guide you through all that&#039;. It&#039;s not simple with them, its not easy and they may even ask you to upgrade to a Cpanel system which means all your emails etc go back to the stone age. I hate you. Before that their 500MB of email space was only 500 accounts at 1mb each - bastards. There&#039;s another $100 given up for extra email space - not what sales tells you. Lies. The Music: What do you think would happen if they actually played depressing / not-upbeat music the whole time? People would be topping themselves. Finally I spoke to &#039;Phil&#039; - who, after spending an hour on the phone and helped me escalate my claim twice - one of my other sites on the server failed. FML . Thank god after a few biscuits and episodes of 24 they fixed what they broke. After now a total of $100 skype dollars of credit wasted they told me to begin it all again as they can&#039;t seem to fix the database for the primary domain or guide me on how to do it. Now, I do wish I was an American so I could go postal on their customer service department. Hear me guys - nothing, not even FREE hosting forever and ever is worth going with these guys. You know when you buy a ticket for a flight at a cheap price but after one piece of luggage and taxes the $60 flight is now $190? Well that&#039;s Godaddy on the web. So much has been lost in business, time and sanity with these guys. It took so long that my house-mate bet me he could learn all the countries in Africa before this problem was solved. http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/dec/20/geography-game-how-well-know-world He got it to 51/51. He beat me - and Bob Parsons I&#039;m gonna hire Jean Claude Van Dame from your stupid ads to come and sodomise you in the skull. I hate you go daddy. "

Superb customer service from GoDaddy over the past week.
Spent time on phone with GoDaddy this morning. Very satisfied with their customer service team &amp; options for small-biz owners. Thank you!
I must say I am so glad we switched to godaddy to host our website! Love their services!
Godaddy has the best service I&#039;ve ever encountered.

Outstanding  product(s) along with professional and very friendly customer support representatives!
"The young lady was sharp. She answered all of my questions. Helped me get my issues resolved and promised to be available to assist me with future issues. She gave me suggestions and ideas to improve my site. She was ""Awesome"" with a capital ""A""."
"At the beginning of my phone conversation I was told that there was nothing that go daddy could do the recifiy the fact that my website didn't pull over from the premium trial to the standard pack that I purchased whilst using the trial.  

I got extremely upset and that is when they looked into it deeper.  Nd that is the only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because they fixed it.

It would be 5 if I did not had to lose it to get to the solution."
Great service and advice. Thanks.
"they hide all the options and information from you until they charge everything they can, the marketing service is very bad, and the profile doesn't let me delete my account. I removed all my products, but it still asks me to delete them. It is not a bug, they just want to charge another month fee. I am very disappointed."
We have not resolved anything yet but I have confidence that I will be taken care of
"Easy to use website builder, even for a novice like me.
Customer service excellent and very patient, thank you to Hannah, from Barcelona, for all her help even when it took a while!"

"Product is great as always! Customer service is attentive and wants to help, but we experienced some serious delays on a product refund. The issue was eventually resolved."
We transferred our site to GoDaddy.  Cost was close to $800.  Then the site went down with no email or call letting us know why.  Happened to be some 30 day trial was up.  Called and had to pay another $45 to get it up and going but a day and a half latter still not up and running.  Not happy
Easy platform to use with excellent customer service.
"I've gotten do many compliments on my website. I have zero web developer skills but thanks to your platform and tutorials and examples, I feel like a pro! Thanks again."
"If I could have given more stars I would have. Wayne helped me tremendously to sort out the confusion I was in, being super patient, very friendly and explaining everything along the way. I learned a LOT!  Phew, what a relief! Thanks so much Wayne, I really appreciate it very much!"

GoDaddy.com had more options and priced better than our last host. Our small business has been using GoDaddy.com webhosting for over 6 years. No issues.I built and designed the site myself and did not use their web building tools. Works good with Dreamweaver.Would recommend.
"GoDaddy is a well-rounded hosting provider, offering four different types of hosting (shared, VPS, Dedicated, and WordPress) and an array of brilliant features. Its pricing plans aren't cheap, but all the extras make GoDaddy a bit special. Alongside hosting, it has a website builder and is the world's largest domain registrar."
"A Convenient Host for Individuals and Starter Resellers
Despite a few kinks in its support and pricing, GoDaddy does provide an easy,painless website hosting experience.
GoDaddy is first and foremost a hosting provider that caters to those new to the hosting scene or who want a very simple hosting experience. That said, it does provide a few advanced features that will accommodate customers with more complex requirements. All of GoDaddy’s services and features are easy to purchase and set up; everything is accessible via an intuitive and clutter-free interface.
It’s not all good news, though. One of the most frequent complaints about GoDaddy is that it has tricky refund policies and that the platform has a lot of upsells. This means that you might end up paying extra for the convenience the platform offers.
So, whether GoDaddy is the right host for you or not, you’ll have to carefully read over the fine print &#8212; especially in terms of what you’ll end up paying long-term. If you do eventually decide to go with GoDaddy, then it’s definitely a very user-friendly and polished service.
Before you make a decision, we highly recommend you check out some alternative hosting companies, which we highly recommend.
Is GoDaddy Any Good? GoDaddy is a decent host if you don�t need a huge amount of resources or you�re just getting started with web hosting.
Do You Have to Use the GoDaddy Website Builder? No, GoDaddy offers regular shared hosting plans that you can use with apps like WordPress or Joomla.
Is Bluehost Better than GoDaddy? Both Bluehost and GoDaddy are budget shared hosting providers and both have their pros and cons. Make sure you read our full comparison review of Bluehost vs GoDaddy before you make your decision.
What Happens to Expired Domains on GoDaddy? When you allow a domain to expire with GoDaddy, you can recover it within 25 days. After this period, the domain will be listed for auction on GoDaddy Auctions.
Is GoDaddy Good for E-commerce? GoDaddy has some decent options for e-commerce, including an e-commerce plan which incorporates a website builder with online store features. You could also create a WordPress website and use WooCommerce to open an online store.

Once a good company but now they are upselling like WellsFargo. Stay away. Many better options. + PROS: Once a good company - CONS: upselling like WellsFargo. reducing space or storage or file limits or emails. Misrepresenting new product capabilities. Repeatedly needing to upgrade when little new added.
"They are an extremely shady outfit…while the prices are low, none of what they said on the phone turned out to be true and they kept charging my card. + PROS: Cheap - CONS: very shady…that refund policy was 30 days for me, and they ping-ponged me through customer service until it was 35 days then said I was out of luck"
"I have used them since 2006, and despite a few problems they have always been very helpful. I really like all the different services they offer so I can deal with everything in one place."
"I have a GD cPanel shared hosting account which include email accounts. I set up whatever email accounts I needed in cPanel for convenience. All was good until a couple weeks ago when all cPanel outgoing email started experiencing long delays (10 minutes – 12 hours). That’s right hours.

I thought it might be a temporary problem, but it didn’t improve. I called/chatted with tech support, tweaked a couple of settings but still no improvement. Eventually I was told, it was the norm on their shared hosting, accept it, and by the way we’d be happy to set you up with a separate email account that will work for an extra monthly charge.

I’m not sure if it’s an intentional slowdown to up-sell people to separate email accounts, or a severely under-resourced SMTP server. I have the feeling it’s an attempt by management to squeeze more revenue out of their customer base. Either way, it’s not right. Don’t include email with cPanel if it’s not going to work.

I only have a few email accounts to migrate but it’s still a hassle. I feel sorry for anybody that might have 100’s. I also feel sorry for the GD tech people that have no other option than to explain over and over that cPanel email doesn’t work and try to make the up-sell."
"This is by far the worst hosting company we’ve EVER used. From day one godaddy monitoring shows the site up and down numerous times most days. Now on month two I get a note saying they will be down while they upgrade to SSDs. Two days later the site begins constantly going down until eventually it’s down for the count. Perhaps a coincidence but two days after they say it will be down for maintenance and now they claim it’s due to ddos attacks. Down for a week and counting? Customer Services comments on support amount to basically saying “hurry up and wait”. Done! Absolutely horrid non-service. + PROS: Initially seems sort of ok - CONS: HORRIBLE conectivity issues and Customer Service doesn’t seem to care. They just keep sending messages saying fixed, down, fixed down etc yet it’s yet to be fixed despite their claims. After a week the server is still down. The worst we’ve ever used!!!"
"Cancellation Reason: Worse customer service ever! During sign up process the information provided was that I could enter the EPP number of the domain I want to transfer from GoDaddy after completion of sign up process. When I returned to the site to update EPP number, they asked for $15 fee to transfer, which I was willing to pay BUT the web interface kept saying product not in the cart to complete transaction. I chatted with their agent who was not helpful at all and opened a ticket After 2 days I opened another ticket but no response. For such a simple thing when you are acquiring a new customer, they have such BAD customer service… I just cannot imagine what it will be like afterwards. And they do not have any phone number to call either. Also, they said 90 days money back guarantee and now while cancelling they said my account was non-refundable… simply amazing customer service. I have NEVER experienced such bad customer service from anyone for new customers in my life even not from telephone service providers who are the worst. Gosh!

Pros: Attractive plans

Cons: Worst customer service"
"Do not use GoDaddy. There are several better choices.

Cons: The resources are so low they are always trying to upsell, even after telling me that I would not have any problems with my current setup."
"I have been with GoDaddy for nearly 15 years with many different websites and projects. There support response times are always good, and I like their cPanel. Although I find it hard to find what I need to do, their support are very helpful when I ask them for help."
"Good for linux hosting not for windows hosting

Pros: Good for linux hosting

Cons: limited support limited size of sql server database"
"Like you, I have seen the many commercials put out by them. I admit, they sucked me in and made me remember them when I went to sign up for web hosting services. Because of their slick marketing campaign, they were the first people I checked out. After a lot of comparison shopping, I ended up going with GoDaddy’s CPanel hosting option.

I’ve been using it for about six months now. I got a pretty good deal for it as they were having a nice sale. Got about 30% off their usual plan (for life!) and it included free domain registration. So I was ready to go in as little as 48 hours once I created my account.

Using the CPanel is pretty easy. Everything is clearly labeled, although things can get a little cluttered and sometimes it takes me a few minutes to find the panel I need. But I attribute that more to my own Luddite lifestyle than their cruddy UI. (It’s not cruddy. I just make it cruddy.) Once I know where something is though, it’s easy for me to find again.

I had some difficult understanding online FTP and how to upload things. I ended up looking at a few Wikis provided by the website which were clear and easy to read. I also had a billing issue that made me panic a little (they were going to charge me for two years up front) and I had to get on the phone right away. I talked to a very nice lady. Real people? Plus! I’m not gonna pretend it was a quick and painless conversation, but she was very polite and did everything she could to get my billing issue sorted out. Twenty minutes later the double charge was redacted.

So there have been some bumps along the way, but for the most part I’ve been happy with my selection of their CPanel hosting service. Are there better service options out there? Undoubtedly. But for this geezer who can barely type most days, I find the easy to use interface of the CPanel exactly what I need. I would recommend it to hobby designers or people who only need to put up a quick and painless website.

Plus, it helps to have good customer service, and that’s exactly what I got. So props to them for that. I look forward to working with them some more!"
"I don’t why people hate GoDaddy so much. When I started my WordPress Blog I was struggling with quite a few things, from setting up various plugins to how to customize certain things on the site. Despite always working on the site very late I was always able to quickly telephone them to get some help.

I thought that they would get fed up with me after the first couple of calls, but they remained very helpful and helped me fix all the issues I came across. I am most likely going to upgrade to their specialised WordPress hosting soon as well, as the support technicians seem to recommeA"
"It was not our choice to leave them after countless wasted hours with your several of their tech support people we were finally told that their excuse for their systems not working was that we had Apple computers. The company is impossible to reach for support. Their technicians are badly trained. Their general arrogance is mind boggling. And finally their promised money back offer turning out to be a credit for services when we are leaving them is a scam. They can keep their credit. We have opted to put them into the stockade of public opinion via youtube, blog, email, and negative reviews every chance the people in our company have. Thanks for 5 years of excuses, spotty service, and poor business ethics. This was just practice for what we intend to say about your company in the future. They rank in the lower satisfaction ratings online and we now know why."
"I have nothing good to say about GoDaddy. I hosted my very first site with them a few years ago, and as many of the commentators already stated, the support was practically none existent. However, who knows, maybe they have bettered themselves since then."
"I moved my successful running website to them and had a hard time to make my website run in the new environment, since basic stuff like sending email is blocked. I managed to bring the website up and it was running fine for few months. Then they moved it to a new environment, without telling me what has changed, just blaming that my code was the problem, when the site did not run anymore. I spent months and ten thousands of USD just to figure out what they did. In the end I gave up.

Their support is practically none existent. The support guys have no idea of ASP.NET, but they don’t let you contact any technical guy. They always blame you, the customer, for the problems they cause. Their documentation is pathetic, support mostly providing links to Microsoft and StackOverflow. Hosting with them was one of my most frustrating experiences in my life.

You should be more careful about your assumptions (like: If your site is so critical, and complex …, you should try another hoster, …) before you want to advice other people. The facts are:

My website did run without any problem with ANOTHER hoster for 5 years ! Unfortunately, I could no longer host there, so I moved to GoDaddy

My website used to run fine with them !!! Until THEY moved it to another server.

I spent several months of MY TIME (>100000$), believing their support that all is my mistake.

Their support has absolutely no understanding of ASP.NET. Example: They said my session configuration was wrong because of a funny IP address in it. But if they would understand anything about ASP.NET session configuration, they would know that with InProcess management, ASP.NET does not read the IP parameter at all. This was even highlighted in the link to Stackoverflow they provided. Which shows that they don’t read/understand the links they provide.

Their support does not know what their own engineers are doing. Some support people kept telling me that my website runs now in a farm, while other support people kept telling me that it is not. When I highlighted this discrepancy to them, they apologised saying the other support person is wrong.

I could go on and on with obviously and utterly wrong answers from their support

They are even not able to provide session management settings for their own environment. The settings I chose worked with the previous hoster, with the old server and on my laptop. I don’t know the difference between the 2 servers, but they really should know. I asked them many times for sample settings, they always refused to do so,

From my experience, I can say with great certainty that there is no communication between their support and engineering. The only thing the support guy does is provide some EXTERNAL links which he thinks might be helpful, even he has not understood the customer’s problem nor the customer’s question.

I didn’t move to a new hoster yet, For months I thought I am close to getting up again, then I run simply out of time. Please note that this is not a commercial website, but a website I wrote for discussion among my friends.First I thought if it is down for few week that is not so bad. But now it has become months,"
"I am starting a business with fairly limited funds. On 4 ⁄ 16, I purchased the website builder and domain. Bc my funds are limited, I paid for 5 years of service upfront. I was trying to build an online store but I could not get the look that I wanted. So I called Go Daddy to cancel & they suggested that I upgrade to their store front platform. So I did but because the storefront is more expensive, I had to add $300 to my credit so that my next payment would not be until 2018.

After several calls/texts to Go Daddy tech support over the next few weeks, I find out that I cannot add any social medial pixels for tracking or do subscription billing bc THE ONLINE STORE DOESN’T ALLOW FOR HTML CODES! I immediately ask for a refund but they denied my request. The suggested that I upgrade to a different product. My obligation was only month to month but they are trying to keep my money bc I paid in advance ($611.40 total). WHAT A SCAM!!

I am disputing this charge thru my bank. BUYER BEWARE!! + PROS: none - CONS: tech support is limited. overpriced compared to competitors. server is super slow"
Very Helpful!  Made it super easy for me!
"GoDaddy is exceptionally well-known in the hosting space, typically serving as site owners' introduction to the world of web hosting. The company makes it incredibly easy and affordable for folks to choose a domain name, sign up for hosting, and start building their online business or personal web property. While known for its domain, email, and shared hosting services, GoDaddy offers options for virtual and dedicated servers as well. The company makes the upgrade process as seamless as possible, so you shouldn't shy away from scaling your site as your business needs grow; GoDaddy is a hosting home that will grow alongside you.

The user control options are pretty popular in the hosting space: your choice between the easy-to-use cPanel or Plesk control panels, plus root (administrative) access for more tech-savvy customers. If you're particularly interested in webmail, GoDaddy offers an intuitive interface for keeping up with the unlimited email accounts you have available to you as a customer. All of this can be easily accessed and secured with your GoDaddy login info that you receive upon sign-up.

Customer support has been a focus of the GoDaddy team of late. Today, the team has an award-winning collection of experts on staff, readily available to handle customer support tickets and emails 24 hours a day, seven days a week. While they're on hand to talk you through any issues, they're also keeping an eye on your server (as well as other clients sharing your server). The company's around-the-clock security monitoring enables GoDaddy to guarantee uptime rates of 99.9% or better. This uptime rate is by no means outstanding in the industry, but for most end users, it's all that's required. 

The bottom line is this: GoDaddy is a go-to domain web host for millions of users worldwide for a reason. The company maintains an ever-expanding network of users by offering blazing-fast load times, award-winning security and support, and a free domain name when you sign up for a year-long plan. It's a great hosting deal, particularly for first-timers and small businesses owners, at a really great price point.

 Simple Installation of Popular Web Apps 
	Using an industry standard like cPanel has a lot of advantages. GoDaddy takes pride in the speed of its administration panel, which conveniently allows for a lot of common applications to be installed in mere minutes.
	There are options for one-click installs of content management systems such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and others.
If you want an ecommerce shop, Magento is available, as well. For most users, these one-click installation options save a lot of time.
 More Advanced Options for Seasoned Users

	The VPS option allows for seamless scaling as your site grows. GoDaddy allows for resource allocation and upgrades without having to provision a new server.
 GoDaddy has long been the go-to solution for beginners just starting out with web hosting. The company's newly released and simplified interface, 1-click application installs, and upgraded support means we can recommend them with confidence. GoDaddy relies on familiar and user-friendly platforms, such as cPanel, Softaculous, CentOS, and Microsoft Office 365, that customers are sure to appreciate. A streamlined drag-and-drop site builder and extensive knowledgebase, coupled with around-the-clock support, mean anyone can design, create, launch, and grow a site within minutes. &quot;Economy&quot; Plan: $1.00/month &quot;Deluxe&quot; Plan: $4.99/month &quot;Ultimate&quot; Plan: $5.99/month Pricing for GoDaddy hosting is very economical at every level, particularly when you consider all the free perks included with the low prices. The company's shared hosting naturally lead the charge on cost-effective hosting, but budget-minded customers can find surprising deals with upgraded VPS and dedicated server plans, as well. The 99.9% uptime guarantee makes it difficult for us to rank GoDaddy among the top providers of the hosting world, as that rate is largely considered the minimum standard in the industry. For most users, however, 99.9% uptime is absolutely plenty. If your website or application requires a higher guaranteed uptime rate, you should consider more premier (and higher priced) hosts or upgraded services. godaddy Includes: 24/7 Phone, Chat, Twitter, and Email Support, Extensive Online Help Center, and Ticketing System To recap, here's a rundown of what GoDaddy has to offer: GoDaddy is a good value in the hosting space — boasting a very low cost for shared hosting services and long-standing credibility in the domain hosting industry. With hosting available for as little as a dollar per month, it's hard to beat the company's price point. By recently revamping its user interface to improve the customer experience, GoDaddy is taking user-friendliness and responsive support to new heights. The company's around-the-clock service features 24/7 server monitoring and an emphasis on balancing performance and security. Although GoDaddy's uptime guarantee isn't outstanding, the company's page load speeds and general reliability are impressive. All in all, GoDaddy is a reliable option to accommodate your hosting needs."
"As someone who is a GoDaddy Turnkey reseller I am perhaps best placed to offer a Review of their services. Without a doubt, they are one of the best value web hosting providers available. The new cPanel hosting is very very good, and the negativity that was very popular a year or so ago about their old dashboard is no longer relevant. They are a very different company now, and the service gets better and better all the time. Whenever you need help fast, you can quickly telephone them and get the support you need.

One of the great things though about them is the ease with which you can manage your hosting account with the brilliantly styled cPanel control panel. Plus, buying domains from them is one of the cheapest ways to do it, and they have great offers ALL the time.

So, can’t recommend them enough."
"Ordered product on 3/22/17 and after working with filling shop with products, proceeded to work on other items along with SEO. I found a glitch in the SEO software and called Tech Support on 3/30/2017. Spoke to 4 different tech support “experts” before Tanner helped me a little. He said he would put a ticket into Advanced Tech support to fix the glitch (he admitted glitch was on their end). I gave them about a week before I called back and spoke to Mike in tech support. He said Advanced Tech support was aware of glitch, but hadn’t been fixed yet and couldn’t give me a time frame to be fixed (He also admitted it was a glitch on their end). Asked for supervisor and spoke to Tucker. He said same thing, that it could be a year or more before glitch was fixed. Then I called customer service for a refund, but they said no refund on monthly products, even though it was a defective product."
"Terrible. I paid $80 to for Expert Services WordPress Performance Review to get the speed on a website faster. I was told it would take 24 to 72hrs to get an expert to check it out, give me recommendation and perhaps even fix it.

4 days passed and I got an email from the wrong department to create a whole new website… I called in. You guys apologized for the delay/mistake and placed my request on priority. I was told it would take up to another 24hrs to get an email with recommendations and/or the site would go faster.

I got an email a few hours later. It was crap and not truthful. I said that my site loaded under 6sec. It does not, it takes 13.6 per GTmetrix. I got nothing for $80. The recommendations were not useful and written for someone completely inexperienced. My programmer even told me to ask for a refund.

I want my money back or someone who will actually try to help. I had also mentioned that there is a 5 second lag from request to first byte received (we think that it is a server problem - no one addressed this). Also, there is 21 second load time for images (totally not acceptable and again potentially a server issue.) Oh, one more thing I forgot to mention, I was told that I would be able to talk to the person making the recommendations, if not email them… I was not able to email them since their email came from no-reply@godaddy.com and I was not able to talk to them either when I called.

Really disappointing. I will not recommend this service to any my clients ever again."
"I see all of this wonderful hype about Go Daddy … I purchased my domain name, their website builder and paid for them to host everything. Over the course of 2 years I received numerous contact from their affiliates around the world trying to sell me their services … obviously my domain name was passed around! I did not receive one business inquiry in 2 years. I just received an auto-renewal notice and their hosting fee is now up to $360 +/-. I have recommended GoDaddy to associates but not anymore, there is no web “exposure” unless you purchase add-ons .. very disappointing and I’ve cancelled all accounts!"
My experience with you has been absolutely awesome
I LOVEd the new Austin office. I worked there since it was a start up and now that it is GoDaddy. It's a great work life balance and a great place to work with a great culture. Unfortunately I think they were still paying the employees start-up prices which almost didn't cover the cost of living for the area and the work that we were doing. I did love the management and the culture. If you're looking for your first job I would recommend it!
"Run. Run far, far away. It was great when it was MSH, but then we weren't anymore and things took a turn. If you are a tall man with a moderately high-priced ath-leisure (or business casual) wardrobe and full of clichés then you were literally made for the job- there is hope for you you bas tard. Otherwise, if you take the job, there is no bidding your time, there is no maybe it gets better, there is just no hope for you. You will not realize your potential and you will be worse off if you take the position. That said, I learned a lot- at the expense of my physical and mental health. I haven't worked there in 3+ months and I am still recovering. Not worth it, not worth it at all. HR won't do anything, nor will senior management even as they proclaim how wonderful and inclusive their culture is. Conditions are deplorable, and the culture is only for superficial children. Side note, the building you would work in will literally poison you with fluorescent light, and there is no place where you cannot be seen and heard. At all."
It’s a sales job I get it but paying us a slightly higher than minimum wage base is ridiculous. The culture wasn’t for me either. Very sales-y overhyped.
"The environment is testosterone and heavy and Sales focused.
There are plenty of opportunities for fun while you work, if you don't easily take things personally."
"The work is not only boring, but they keep giving you more and more until you can't remember what creativity even means -- which makes their constant push to be ""creative"" frustrating at best. The only thing they really care about is the bottom line -- not the customers and certainly not the employees. If they cared at all about the employees they'd be paid a fair wage. Not to mention the pay discrepancy among people with the same job, which they refused to address."
"100 cold dials daily, learn the full sales cycle from prospecting to closing, managers are good, good social aspect to the office and fun place to work"
The training was short but after that this is a great place to work. Benefits are good and the management is talented. Pay is good and goals are achievable.
GoDaddy has many great offices to work from along with allowing work from home. This office also offer's free parking and casual dress attire each day.
Had to ring support to make payment via net. They seemed unaware of cart issue when buying domain name
"Great customer service. 
A great deal of delightful humour.
Amazingly patient and respectful!
Understands business"
"Not very helpful to put my site online.  I didn't know I had to edit my site inserting keywords, when I had already published the site.  This meant I had lost time with my site doing nothing and no one had told me.  Again no one told me that I would have to pay hosting when I had spent time designing my website and buying a domain.  The customer service person just said that I could publish my site, wait a couple of days, then it would go live.  Now i have been told having paid hosting, a domain and website to be designed, finishing the editing and finally publishing again - that I will be able to see my site in a couple of days in a google search. That I should be receiving my first customers.   I hope this is correct!  
Also a little bit of a follow up would put me at ease.  
Thank you"
Excellent service
"Absolutely rubbish,  would not recommend at all. The web site editor is an absolute shambles tried so hard to navigate,  couldnt connect to server kept deleting my page and covering it with templates , i feel like I have wasted a whole day and feel like I have been scammed. Very disappointing start to building my first website. Currently have been on hold trying to get a refund for the past hour."
"Could offer more options on everything, less limitations.  For example, posting ""content"" on a new page:  everything says ""post as much as you lie"", but that is not true."
I recommend GoDaddy to anyone who wants a fun and exciting place to be. Very casual place and management was very helpful to anything you needed when on the job.
"In the sales department, your supervisors care 10x more about numbers than your overall work flow. I have to say I had two different supervisors and one made me entirely hate my job, and the other was great until I felt like leaving, that supervisor pushed me to quit on the spot instead of putting my two weeks in because it would hurt his numbers, which makes sense but isn't very caring for their employees."
Terrible job and poor work environment. Loud and immature work area at times. Typical call center and once they feel too many are hitting sales quota they change the structure to make it more difficult
GoDaddy had great leadership. They put you in a position for advancement and everyday i learned something new. Although the culture was great at the end of the day they only care about making the company money. If your not liked or a top performer they find a way to get rid of you.
From training to first day on the job i was thrown in the water and told to swim. By the time i hit my 1st year 90% of my training class quit or got fired. It is a constant grind. Call after call. So many metrics to hit. Now i was one of the lucky ones who swam. I made great money but every year they cut my bonus. It came to a point where i had to ask what am i worth. Im doing the same job. Exceeding my peers and getting paid less. I felt im worth more than what they were offering. They dont really care to keep anyone from leaving. Your just a number on a excel sheet.
The pay is horrible for the work they require. To meet bonus range requires you to sacrifice your ethics and morals to push products on every customer even if they don't need it
"Loved the atmosphere, and the leadership, but when they wanted everyone to build revenue, it made the job aspects almost impossible, and really destroyed alot of work place structure."
They're more focused on numbers than their employees also super harsh with their attendance policy. If you like sales and making sure that your life is going to all about work it's a good place for you
"May 3, 2020:
So tired of this site."
Great help over phone but not with email help
They lost my 5-day data.
"The wait to call for assistance is too long. Some of the features are hard to find and process is a little unwieldy 

Overall pretty good. 

There should be a video to walk people through the process of starting out. But happy with the service."
Most useful helpline I've used in a long time. Only had to wait a couple of minutes and got to speak to Wayne who was very good. They even offered a lower price than the website and saved me almost £100..... well recommended A+++++
"It is easy to buy domain names on Go Daddy website but don't be drawn in by their add-ons which appear after adding items to your basket.  Some are completely ad hoc and you would need to have read the website about the product offerings before throwing them into your basket.
Their packages come with free add-ons so, research all the items you may want to buy from GoDaddy upfront before purchasing anything.  
l would advise you speak to their customer service first before proceeding with any purchase to ensure you are purchasing the correct items for your stage and skill set.
Customer service was great though when refunding me my money and talking me through the correct items for my level of experience...so talk to them first if you are inexperienced in this stuff."
"Extremely easy to use. I love how godaddy gives me tips on how to better my website, making it easy to maneuver & ways to attract potential clients & customers to my website. I also like how I can use my website for multiple uses."
Godaddy does a really good job and making their locations a fun place to work. There are good opportunities especially if you are a smooth seller. Pay is competitive and bonuses are available if you sell past your quotas.
Good service today from daniel9563 Explained the issue that i was experiencing and he patiently talked me through a resolution. Appreciate the help.
daniel9563 told me everything I needed so I can publish my website. Thanx for the help!
"hi my web side is americacleaners.com Go daddy migrate my web site to another server and my website stop working properly. however they send me a email that migration was successful and my web side is running.a month later I received a couple emails from my clients they can. not make a pick up delivery orders on my web site .(error 505).I called customer service and I was on the phone for 2 hours  try to resolve the problem and guy name David keep telling  me there is a problem, my web side is not working properly on that server .he said the problem should be fix by my developer or I can pay for the new web side!!!!!when I try to explain to him that my web side was working just Fine and the problem was caused by them  when they migrate my web side  from one server to another and I think it should be there responsibility to fix my web side or make me a new one at there Owen expense he told me there is nothing he can do for me  I have to pay some body to fix it  or pay for new web side My web side was working perfect  for my business and because they decide to migrate my website to another server I have to pay 2000$ of my company money for they screw up.they don't want to take any responsibility for they screwing up my web side and help client to resolve the issue .I've been a loyal customer for  go daddy for the past 20 years and thats what I get in return."
"I was surprised that the first set-up wasn't set up properly the first time. I felt that I wasn't informed about what I was trying to complete. 

Also, I can't find the way to work on the web page. I wish it easier to go straight to my website and fix things/add items."
"Directions were sent to me by e-mail. Of 8 steps listed, they fell apart on step 3 and I was unable to go any further. I called for help, some were helpful, some were not. Overall, I am getting it done so I give you 4 stars."
"Fantastic service, easy to use and well supported."
"Godaddy is an interesting company being that their structured to seem like tech support if you are the customer. But as someone who worked there, we definitely were not tech support, but more so website hosting sales. And most customers didn't know this. This made making sales a challenge and essentially required you to sit and really try to rope every single call into some sort of a sale. This puts a large pressure on you because there are a lot of times it does not feel appropriate to make a sales offer, but the job expects you to nonetheless. I personally did not fit with this aspect, the overall constant pressure of it. I performed well and hit my metrics on par with my team, even for an outsider, but this still just put a large hamper on my overall mental well being and had to depart. Most of the people I was hired with had quit before I did. Out of the 10 people hired with me, only 9 made it out of training, and after I left, there were only 2 left. However those 2 got promoted because they sold so much. And this companies bonus structure is very competitive and you definitely can make several thousand dollars a month off of bonuses. But you have to be okay with a nonstop pressure to sell in a very touchy environment that is also in an ever changing landscape that is ""internet services."""
GoDaddy provided me a place to grow my knowledge and improve my abilities of handling complex tasks and difficult problems. I had opportunities to grow in my career as well as the work life balance required to do so.
"The freedom to be who you are and do what you're passionate about is great here. It can be hard in certain operations roles to chart a career path and move up and onward, but there is a lot of opportunity for people who are willing to prioritize their own learning and can advocate for themselves."
"Satisfied to work in my first datacenter career. also love the company culture who helps each other closely. Also, the manager likes to help to work with an open mind."
"Awful company. Been with them 10+ years. Searched a domain yesterday, available, 50$. Go to buy it today, godaddy owns it and wants 2,000$ for it. This is the SECOND time they have done this to me in the past year. I'm over it. I ... Read More
would recommend you never do business with this company. They use algorithms to follows searches, and when you find good domains they auto-buy it before you get a chance to check out. This is called ""domain name front running"" and while not illegal it is unbelievably shady. Stay away from Godaddy, they will scam you and steal your money. I am transferring everything I own to name cheap dot com, a wonderful competitor.

"Are the GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans a good choice for your website?



It's no surprise that GoDaddy offers plans tailored to the most popular content management system (CMS) on the web (WordPress!). Depending on your needs, the handy features that GoDaddy's WordPress plans provide could help your website succeed.





For our GoDaddy review for WordPress, we'll take a closer look at the features it offers, as well as its support system, performance, and prices. Let's get to it!











⚙️ Features



GoDaddy boasts a lot of variety when it comes to hosting. It provides shared plans, virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated options, and of course, WordPress-specific offerings.



Here's a full breakdown of the features you can access with the Basic WordPress hosting tier:



Free business email and domain for one yearDaily malware scans with SucuriAutomatic backups with one-click restoreSFTP access to your serverOut-of-the-box integration with a content delivery network (CDN)Automatic WordPress core updates



It's a decent feature set, although there's nothing here that's particularly unique compared to other hosts. 



The Ultimate plan serves up additional features including unlimited malware removal and hack repair, and one-click staging.



More impressively, the Ecommerce plan includes free access to premium WooCommerce features and extensions like WooCommerce Subscriptions. The premium extensions alone are worth thousands of dollars and offer serious value if you're creating a WooCommerce store.



📞 Support options and quality



GoDaddy's support quality is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, it offers 24/7 availability all throughout the year. However, the easiest way to contact a specialist is via phone.



Whether that's a pro or a con depends on your personal preferences. Other options include searching the GoDaddy Help articles, seeking assistance via the community forums, or – if you can find it – a live chat option tucked into the Product Support page:







You have to set your region as the United States in order for the live chat button to appear, which can be confusing for some users. This option is also only available from 5am–6pm Mountain Time, making it somewhat inconvenient for GoDaddy's international customers.



While support availability is generally good, the quality itself can be hit or miss. In our 2018 WordPress hosting survey of over 830 users, GoDaddy received the following scores for support (out of 5):



Overall support: 3.3WordPress-specific support: 3.3



While not horrible, it's below many other cheap WordPress hosts:



SiteGround: 4.7 (overall) / 4.5 (WordPress-specific)InMotion: 4.2 / 3.8DreamHost: 4.0 / 3.9A2 Hosting: 3.7 / 3.6Bluehost: 3.2 / 3.4



🏎️ Performance



Performance is a vital consideration when choosing a web hosting plan. Website optimization will only take you so far if your server is sub-par. For our GoDaddy review for WordPress, we took a look at all the speed-boosting features it offers, such as:



CDN integration. As we mentioned earlier, all of GoDaddy's WordPress plans provide out-of-the-box CDN integration for increased site speed.Load-balanced, clustered server environments. GoDaddy's servers are optimized for WordPress. Additionally, they're prepared to handle traffic spikes that might otherwise crash your site.99.9% uptime guarantee. GoDaddy provides an uptime guarantee in its contracts that enables customers to request account credits in the amount of 5% of their monthly bill if it fails to meet the minimum requirement. 



Like the features available in GoDaddy's Basic WordPress hosting plan, nothing here stands out as particularly unique or better than other providers. However, you can rest assured that you're at least receiving decent performance optimization.



Basic load testing with Load Impact



In a nutshell, traditional performance tests paint only half a picture. Even if you get stellar results after multiple consecutive runs, that doesn't tell you how your server will fare if it faces a sudden influx of traffic.



Recently, we compared several of the most popular WordPress hosting providers, including GoDaddy. We ran some pretty exhaustive performance tests for each host, including some load impact analyses.



For our stress test, we used Load Impact and had it simulate up to 40 concurrent users for our GoDaddy WordPress site. Here are the minimum and maximum response times from our results:



Minimum response time: 0.63 secondsMaximum response time: 0.83 seconds



Those are respectable numbers for any web hosting service. They're not the fastest we've seen, but the results are right up there. Overall, the performance to price ratio you get with GoDaddy WordPress hosting is not terrible.



Uptime with our hosting monitor



Having your site's server up and running is crucial. When it's down, you're missing out on ad revenue, email subscriptions, sales, and page views. GoDaddy guarantees 99.9% uptime, but our hosting uptime monitor shows a noticeable difference with GoDaddy frequently coming in below that mark.







While the difference between 99.9% and 99.1% uptime might not seem like a lot, that comes out to almost six hours of added downtime per month, which is substantial.



As a silver lining, you would be able to get a 5% discount if your site goes under the 99.9% uptime guarantee.



💰 GoDaddy WordPress hosting pricing



When it comes to WordPress, GoDaddy offers a managed service at some of the lowest prices on the market.



GoDaddy falls firmly under the category of budget WordPress hosting, with its most expensive plan coming in at just $15.99 per month:







Here's what you get with each plan, beyond the features we discussed before:



Basic ($6.99 per month): 1 website, 30 GB of storage, and up to 25K monthly visitors.Deluxe ($9.99 per month): 1 website, 75 GB of storage, and up to 100K monthly visitors.Ultimate ($12.99 per month): 1 website, unlimited storage and visitors, and a free SSL certificate.Ecommerce ($15.99 per month):  1 website, unlimited storage and visitors, and a free SSL certificate. 



Unfortunately, GoDaddy only supports a single website on every one of its basic WordPress hosting plans, which is a massive downside even at these prices. If you want to host multiple sites, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro plans, which start at a pricier $24.99 per month.



Another important factor to be aware of is that many of the features GoDaddy promotes in conjunction with its WordPress plans are available for free via plugins. Its daily malware scans are performed by Sucuri, its 'SEO Optimizer' is just Yoast, and WooCommerce provides unlimited products and no transaction fees out of the box.



On a positive note, GoDaddy does bundle a lot of premium WooCommerce add-ons with its top tier. These extensions are collectively worth thousands of dollars per year, so it's worth considering if you're starting an online store with WooCommerce.



As usual, to get the prices you see on the website, you need to sign up for a long-term contract. The fees mentioned above are available for a minimum of 36-months, which is pretty standard for budget hosts. For month-to-month payments, the Basic plan goes up to $12.99 per month.



Why not use GoDaddy's cheap shared plans?



Finally, it's worth mentioning GoDaddy's basic shared hosting plan is only one dollar cheaper than its managed WordPress counterpart. 



Additionally, excluding the lowest tier, all of GoDaddy's shared plans let you host unlimited websites, whereas the GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans limit you to a single website.



Those shared plans still let you install WordPress with a one-click installer, so why not use them?



Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with doing that. But the benefit of the WordPress-specific plans is that you get access to optimized WordPress performance, as well as beneficial features such as:



Automatic updatesStaging sitesMalware and hack removalBundled WooCommerce plugins



*The exact features depend on which plan you sign up for.



➕➖ Overall pros and cons



To close out our GoDaddy review for WordPress, here's a summary of its best features:



Prices are among the best for managed WordPress plans.You get access to an excellent list of features (especially for eCommerce).The performance is solid for the price.



On the other hand, the biggest downside to GoDaddy's WordPress plans, in our opinion, is that they only support a single website. If you want to host multiple sites, you'll need to look into its Pro Plans.



Beyond that, GoDaddy makes it difficult to find and use its live chat support option, which is not optimal. It's also important to mention for those who aren't experienced WordPress users that many of the features it lists are available for free with Sucuri, Yoast, and WooCommerce.



🏆  GoDaddy WordPress hosting review conclusion





Not too long ago, GoDaddy was synonymous with terrible performance and support.



However, lately, it's been putting a lot of effort into offering better services across the board.











In a nutshell, GoDaddy WordPress hosting plans offer adequate performance and a pretty attractive feature lineup, especially for online stores. However, we can only recommend it if you're looking to host a single website. Otherwise, you're better off looking elsewhere.

"Spent months trying to resolve issues with a domain name transfer. Customer service staff clearly have no training and just 'guess' the whole time. Lost hours and hours of time on emails, phone calls and online chats, but still no progress. Answering a phone in a cheerful and pleasant way, but totally failing to fix problems, is still failing to fix problems. Even when I finally managed to get some of the transfers cancelled that had been pending for months, they kept the money. Worst company I have ever used and I bitterly regret having anything to do with them."
I think that you need to explain the processes and give more clear information as to what is actually needed with a website as opposed to what products you want us to buy.

"Any website edits on GoDaddy result in I/O Usage going over the limit and website becoming VERY slow. Very frustrating! Also every time you ring support for help, they always try to sell you something. Obviously they get paid commissions. I have just swapped over to another hosting provider and all of these issues have magically resolved. I also get the ssl security and backups included with the deal...whereas GoDaddy charge you for these extras."
"I started a Go Daddy website and domain in march 2019, comparing discounts offered with other web makers but then in 2020 the auto renewals ended up being nearly double the amount i paid one year earlier and although everything stated AUS dollars you then get stung international trans fees on your card and when i rang to investigate, I was told I was charged for an extra web security that the operator said I didn't need as was already included but they would not refund me as I needed to report within 30 days of billing, except you don't really know when they will bill you. I asked for help as all work lost due to Covid19 and they offered nothing. Really disappointing and will be changing my website before next renewal."

"I decided to transfer all of my domains away from GoDaddy after they tried to charge me $12,000 to get my standard domain back after I mistakenly let it expire.
I left it until the remaining 4 domains with them were close to expiring so as to avoid wasting my subscription. I even went as far as not updating my expired credit card details so they could not auto renew my domains.

"Terrible customer service, they parked my domain after I used its search engine and then proceeded to try and make me pay over 100 to get it back. Do not use its search engine or else they will buy your domain."
"no point talking to the trashy salesman. the bean counters see a buck and go for it. ok I was a week overdue and they nailed and sold my domain name that I had held on to for 20 years.
they are scum."
I purchased a way cheaper business email address & web domain than what other companies offered. Happy with everything besides the fact that I have to log into Outlook and THEN Godaddy to access my emails. I hope there is an update soon where I can log in directly rather than double handling.
Spoke to 4 useless customer service people in a row. Spent over 2 hours on phone to them. The domain i owned and wanted to transfer was cancelled by one of those guys in the frustration of the calls even though i had renewal until 2021. They kept saying i did it. Hopeless. So much fluff. Frustrated as helL!
"I have set up 2 websites before for other companies and this is the first I set up with GoDaddy.  It is intuitive, easy to follow and has great templates that are easily modified to fit your need."

As soon as I figure out how to dump Godaddy and retain my email address and domain name I'll be changing.
Good grief. I've just read other reviews. I thought I might have been alone. This mob sound like they need to be investigated."

l of intelligence. WRONG! No apology either at this point. I then ask what can you do for me price-wise, I am happy to pay more but 7 times more is a joke, look after me as a customer. They said we can cancel the SSL and you can do this by yourself. Your website will go down until you reissue the SSL, we WON'T help you if you get stuck. Seriously? I am paying for a product! You need to provide it. They must love the Ferengi and the Rules of acquisition 'Once you have their money... you never give it back.' Because this is the vibe I get whenever I deal with them. Stay away. Once my good friend who is in IT able to I am changing everything away. They don't care about customer retention even though it takes more money to get a new one than it does to keep one. Learn some good business Go Daddy!"
"The sale person misled me to think $417 webhosting renewal include SSL Certificate, I am not happy with Sale misled me that to believe the Hosting total $417 included the SSL price, instead of extra $337.93 on top of hosting renewal become total $754.93
however, I only found out when credit card statements, He deducted an extra $337.93 on top of $417, makes the total bill $754.93
When I want to complaint, the supervisor to me to go to US legal dept, NOT in Australia base."
"https://letsencrypt.org has been providing free SSL certificates for years, yet GoDaddy tries to charge $109.99 a year, trying to scam non-technical people. I have never requested anything to ""auto-renew"". Oh also I can't disable it because their website has technical issues. Avoid at all cost, I just moved everything away from those scammers."
Daniel was very helpful! And had an articulate manner. Thanks again
"My domain registration lapsed as the email from GoDaddy to renew went to my junk folder.
Now, because I wanted to keep everything with another provider - I deactivated my domain name under godaddy's account page.
Well - little did I know that they were going to hold it active in their name - on the icann database - so that I'd have to pay them an extra $80usd redemption fee to release it!!!!
Really appalling tactics..."

"Domain Alliance, a search engine optimisation (seo) service, contacted me to promote their service three days after I built up my website through GoDaddy. I have paid them since they know all the details of my website, including my name, so I think they must know it from GoDaddy. However, I could not see any progress after paying the money.
I have been contacting them for refund, but of course no response.
I have contacted GoDaddy on the livechat, contentcomplaints@godaddy.com,
and udrpdisputes@godaddy.com. They kick the issue to each other and nobody gives a try to resolve it.
Now I have a big doubt on the quality of GoDaddy's customer service too. I won't renew the website with GoDaddy again."
Never again...scabs wouldn't refund my money even after I upgraded after speaking to them and taking their advise and it was still crap... would never recommend anyone to use them
Mum has had a website hosted by Go Daddy for the past 5 years. This week she received a renewal & they tried to put up the price she had originally paid by 500%. She managed to negotiate the price down. The call centre operator from Go Daddy advised because her site was 5 years old her website would need to move from an old platform to a new platform but that if she made payment it was a quick job & he would do it for her. She made payment then he never returned her call & other call centre operators she has since spoke with have told her sorry this would not be possible & she would need to rebuild her website from scratch. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
If you want to get a web page up in a hurry GoDaddy is the way to go. From the site builder app to their customer service they are top notch. I will say the Site Builder though it works with Edge it works better on Chrome.
"Godaddy not only deserves NO STARS but it deserves investigating. It has the dodgiest business practices. After an enquiry into the banking industry, web services could be next. It's full of charletons and shysters and GoDaddy are one of the worst. Their business model is built around confusion, fear and dishonesty. After having been tricked into getting their WebBuilder+eCommerce package I discovered it had very little capability and wouldn't do what I wanted. The demo video had been carefully constructed to gloss over the inabilities.

was left with cPanel hosting. The SSL installation process was an absolute nightmare: complex, convoluted and no support. When I go through the Chat help, it involves over an hour of explaining at length what the problem is (with people who don't really understand English, and don't even try to suggest that's racist, because I have no idea what race they are. I only know that they don't (or pretend not to) understand English. They could be Australian for all I know.) The ""advice"" I have received from GoDaddy has been inconsistent (even between Customer Reps), and in most cases, just plain wrong. Most times I have worked out the issue for myself, using google search and logic. The customer service reps aren't listening to the problem, they're looking for a way to sell you something else. I feel for them, I really do, I'm sure that not EVERYONE at GoDaddy is trying to rip people off. Most people try to do the right thing but I'm sure the GoDaddy business model doesn't accommodate that. The management team at GoDaddy should be ashamed of themselves. I would think that for all their trickery and immoral efforts at pinching that extra buck out your pocket, they would be far better off having a sensible business model, backed by authentic customer service and building trust with the customer. The customer would GLADLY buy services from a company that can be trusted and that offers real support. GoDaddy is NOT that company. Go elsewhere."
"Don't believe on the bought 5 star reviews, look around and do some research . Took me some money to find out what this company does.

Horrible customer service and horrible hosting services. Doing my research I found out a lot about this company and so should you! That's why I'm wasting my time writing this Review so you won't do the same mistake I did !"
I am moving my hosting from GoDaddy to another provider. I am tired of the lame excuses and lack of proactive support for my small business. I have been with GoDaddy for over 10 years and they have clearly demonstrated to me that my continued business is inconsequential to them. 5 days 9 sites have been down and no resolution has been forthcoming. No wonder they don’t rate in the top of the service providers by any independent review.  Enough is enough.
Reliable services and great offerings. Pricing is reasonable and the user interface is easy to navigate. I use GoDaddy for my own business and recommend to my clients. When support is needed (rarely) I can always reach a person who knows the product. I've never gotten a script-reader who has no idea what I'm talking about.
Website builder is easy to use and customer service is extremely helpful!
"I would give it 5 stars as it is so nice and simple to compose, and my viewers prefer it over the other one we had.
Unfortunately, the pricing is confusing. I composed the site and then it said it would be £48. Is that per month or year? Then when it was up and running it told me I have to agree to the annual payment of *%)*£$""!, an amount I couldn't see as it was in symbols like this. I also thought there was a year's free trial but it took £70 out of my account. I'm just hoping it's not per month"
"The program does a lot and there is a good deal that I like about it but it's not always user friendly, especially if you are not a techie.  There need to be interactive training sessions offered on different topics.  I absolutely detest the email marketing templates and find them very hard to use compared to the old way.  Pulling the right information in reports is frustrating.  I think it needs to be simplified or provide training so that everyone can use all of the features without frustration.  For instance, we recently integrated our Dog Park gates with Kisi.  From both ends (Kisi and Gingr) the instructions were much less than acceptable.   It caused us time and a good deal of additional expenses to figure it out on our own."
Everything went Great. Chris did a fine job.
"Customer service rep was knowledgeable, patient and professional.
Very pleasant experience."
"I representative was very helpful and very kind. She made the purchasing portion quick and easy, while explaining each step!"
"Leon helped me solve my problem and he was professional and expert in the issue. My only comment is if go daddy has another way for reaching tech support without incurring international call cost.

"Godaddy has made it easier than ever to create a website that not only works great on many platforms but also is easy to assemble and use.
The on call staff have been extremely helpful in simplifying this experience while friendly and very professional on every call.
I'm glad I made the change to Godaddy!"
"Customer service: delightful. Proactively helpful with something I hadn't even asked about. Web builder: Easy, but templates lacking; inspiring me to learn HTML to get more than one PDF on a page and gain some flexibility with alignment."
"The web builder was very user friendly and making changes and re-publishing the site can be done with ease. However, despite being advertised as being able to be googled easily, your site will not show up. I received two emails after I signed up and paid my fees requesting $300-$400 to show up on the major web search engines. Even if I put in the business name exactly, it will not get a hit from a search engine. I went through their “marketing” support to make changes to key words etc. and still nothing."
"Easy process, patient tech support, and excellent tools for quickly personalizing my website."
The website builder is easy to use and make changes. The overall website if very difficult to use and find where you want to go. I find it extremely frustrating.
"Another positive experience with Godaddy Phone Support Team!!! 
Once again, I had a pleasant conversation with GoDaddy's Technical Support after I found out my email was not working due to my technical incompetency...

Not a bad place if you want basic hosting. It is relatively reliable and the support is (eventually) there. Also it is an old player in the field and unlikely to close up shop any time soon.

GoDaddy has recently introduces a quite useful Worldpress hosting package, which works well. But they have been often twicking it, which was causing some delays and off times, though not quite often. In overall I recommend GoDaddy, although if reliability factor is crucial for your website you might want to look somewhere else.

GoDaddy are my go-to for domains as a developer. Amazing customer service over the phone and just bloody easy to work with. Been mucked around by other providers for domains but never had an issue with GoDaddy.

From a link in header menu, the contents in 'subfolder B' can be seen. What GoDaddy did was moving the contents in 'subfolder A' to the root directory, at the highest level of a hierarchy. I lost the contents in 'subfolder B' and I ended up having fixed the links to over 1000 images. DO NOT trust their content migration service."
They allow people to join that make out there a huge company when in fact there one person. They allow there users to steal policy’s from other users. They allow domains to put up threats to customers. They allow users that don’t even own a company to make out there huge. When in fact there nothing .You waist your time making reports. As nothing gets done as promised
Pathetic service. They charged the CC as soon as you check-out but never received any email with instructions on installations. Their staff are very dodgy on the Chat Session. They just vanish without resolving the issue particularly the girl Lakshmi Soumya
"Auto renewed 13 days before expiry!! Seems very unethical given they retry if payment is unsuccessful 6 days before and on expiry date with no site downtime?? So what I have paid for hasn't expired yet, and you take out two years on an auto renew 13 days in advance for no technically relevant reason? Wouldn't refund, no offer of even a credit! I have several domains purchased through Godaddy, but my business will be going to another provider that cares about their customers and doesn't create policy that has no practical application"
Do not recommend to use. Bad customer service. I was on the line for more than half an hour before being able to talk to any one. I was getting charged without using my account.
"I had a product changed within the cooling off period and so was entitled to a full refund, however, I was dealing with customer service at the time and they suggested just applying a credit as it was a switch. She did that for me however the credit did not apply to the new order and so I was charged twice. This was not what was reflected on my receipt but what was reflected on my bank account. I have now followed this up with 4 different customer service reps on 4 different occasions who have all assured me different things regarding the refun... Read more

d. One said it had already been processed and I had to wait 18 business days. After that period elapsed I contacted again and they said that nothing had been processed and it was still sitting as a credit and that they would see if they could get it approved to be refunded (this is what I had been told in the first instance!!) another assured me it would be processed today and I would receive a confirmation email within the hour and that it would be in my account within 5 business days. Now no one is responding to my enquiries and I still do not have a refund. I have spent more time now on this issue than the refund is worth and am very disappointed with their service! My advice is to steer clear"
"We signed a three year deal with Godaddy for web hosting which included hosting the website and email. After two years into the deal, they have contacted us and said they no linger wish to provide this sort of email service and are cancelling it. We are now required to pay them for access to our email. The base level of email service is around 50% of the original hosting cost. Do not believe that this company will honour their contracts."
"What a blatant rip-off. They change things around and then add extra costs onto unwanted rubbish. AVOID THESE SCAMMERS!!!!! Just doing the basics is a nightmare. Bad, bad, bad, BAD!!!!"
"I wanted to change Godaddy to do my hosting and they promised they will guide me through the whole process but they let me down.
They sent me articles which were incorrect,I called them and they admitted to that and then they said to me now you need to do the second part of transfer of your file by yourself and this part is more difficult.The lady I spoke to was very rude so they sent me another instructions to do everything by myself.Before I paid my subscription they promised they will help me and basically now they wished me good luck.
Well Godaddy very horrible customer service experience!!!! You should be ashamed of it!!! I am very disappointed!!!"
Never go with Godaddy. They increase prices year by year. If you forgot to renew your domain or hosting it is a fortune for them. It starts from $250.00 onwards. Don't rely on them. keep a backup always. Better find another company for a piece of mind.
"Godaddy is a horrible choice for Australians planning to host their website. Here are some points on why they're bad:
-Clunky and slow interfaces, outdated technologies, frustratingly bad menu system: it's filled with menus on top of menus, the design could be so much simpler.
-Their nearest data center is in ASIA, meaning if you host with them your website is significantly SLOWER compared to an Australian hosted web service.
-Downright horrible service
-Outdated documentation, making troubleshooting issues using their documentation much harder
-Restrictive email relaying system
-SSL system filled with bugs and issues"
"I lost weight sweating bullets with the poor hosting experience I had with Go Daddy. I didn't mind paying the charges of over 800 dollars to move three sites across with SSL but the experience I was put through with the never ending phone calls to get issues fixed which I had paid for was mind blowing. I didn't find the staff to be rude at all and acted professional but the service delivery was just failing non stop which was constantly getting me back on the phone ALL..THE ...TIME.

Never in my life have I experienced such poor levels of servi... Read more

ce delivery and never from companies as big as GD. I honestly believed the bigger was the better approach and boy was I wrong. I lost an entire week dealing with GD instead of dealing with my clients and with my main business site down because of simple SSL issues Ilost God knows how much revenue. I didn't mind paying the money if I received the service and promptly but this was nowhere near the case with GD. I moved my sites away from GD cause I just gave up dealing with them and from 800 plus dollars with GD, I paid 150 with another company for three sites and with free SSL and the sites were migrated over in less than a day, not nearly a week as it was with GD. They may be ok with domain registrations but I would never recommend hosting with these guys. Like the title says..Save your money and avoid the headaches"
"We lost out whole website due to their consultant incompetence. We have prolonged the expiring hosting Cpanel over the phone but the representative forgot/didnt do it right. Therefore, the services were canceleed and we lost the whole websote. Wanted to charge us 250 dollars for restoration even though it was their fault."
"I was called by one of the go daddy sales team telling me that the domains they were hosting for me were on old technology and needed to be upgraded. I was travelling loads at the time for work and agreed to the upgrade. The so called upgrade was very misleading as what they did was provide microsoft office 365 licences to all my family that we didnt need, didnt know we had nor did we use it. The bill came to $1400, it was charged to my Amex card and when i picked it up a few weeks later they refused to refund it. Ive sinced moved everything to Dream host and couldnt be happier (for a fraction of the cost)"
"All my blogs and sites domains are hosted with GoDaddy windows economy shared hosting. Till now i have not faced any big issues. 99% Uptime guarantee, 24/7 customer service available and great technical support."

These guys are so shonky. I cancelled my plan which had 2 weeks left until renewal. Straight after cancellation they denied me access to the FTP and I could not transfer files. Said I had to pay a an extra $150 to get data back.
"SSL was meant auto renew in October, was charged 2 months prior to the date. Had to cancel my service to get refund, lost 2 months of my prepaid service."
"I received a call from a salesman. Telling me that as my web server was not secure I should pay up to roll over onto a secure server.

This would be ok IF I didn’t have another 14 months on my current contract (paid up as a 5 year plan). PLUS the guy on the phone made me feel as if I didn’t take up the offer the cost would escalate next year. Ever felt like you’ve got a gun to your head GoDaddy?? Essentially they wanted me to pay up $450 now to “secure” my price and roll over early - thus they secure my business for another 5 years!

I asked t... Read more

hat he sent me this information in an email. He did and it was so rude and unprofessional, with no explanation and no address to me. I was so concerned about my hosting tonight that I rang customer service to see if I could gain further clarification. Thank God the person I spoke to put my mind at ease and emphasised that I was under no obligation or pressure to take this offer - however, it was stressed to me that my current server was like an “old car”. Does this mean they sold me a sub standard product 5 years ago?? This sales tactic is LOW. I am a small business with limited means. When I paid my 5 years in good faith I did not expect to receive a hard sales pitch 14 months out from the end of my time."
I have tried 15 times to get godaddy to fus my SSL issues. Why am I paying them over $600 a year for services and $300 for SSL. So incompetent
"I received a call from Godaddy saying that I needed to change hostings within their company because the old version was going to e deleted, which then I agreed to pay for the new hosting and requested for the old one to be removed, nevertheless, they never removed the old hosting and instead charged as their product is setup to have auto renewals. In addition, I was charged for an autorenewal for an email product that was given me for free and I was never informed about that product.

Be very aware of what they really sell you."
I used Go Daddy for domain registration and email hosting because they were cheap. I had a great experience with godaddy . They refunded a fee with no hastles at all
"Dear Go Daddy thank you so much for your Monday motivation. And absolutely, the journey must first begin, only thing is your service is a complete contradiction to the marketing messages you are “selling” to the hard working business owners and consumers here in Australia.
Well because you asked what steps we took to turn our entrepreneurial idea into reality we thought it was only fair to answer - here we go:
We have spent over one thousand hours and we have spent over $6,000 dollars to not even complete one step with Go Daddy.
Our small but ... Read more

awesome business sought out your services over 4 months ago as we were expanding ( yay this is meant to be something to celebrate) and wow what a humble beginning you have offered us. Where does one begin when they have so many encounters? Ok well, let’s see we migrated our account across, couldn’t send emails for about 1 month, had our account hacked despite us having Azure set up and 2 point authentication - We were advised by one of your team members not to worry its just malware! ( oh ok Malware bots are so friendly said no-one ever) After several fruitless hours/ calls to your dedicated support team, we finally made an inroad and it was admitted to us that the issues were experiencing were due to the fact that the security had been removed by one of your team members, who was just so excited to sell us the latest Wordpress package, and they believed in the product so much that they felt it was ok to completely compromise their customers accounts to make a sale. ( are you serious ) Your staff must be on KPIs as this is just B/S. We then escalated this to Microsoft premium 365 who will be in touch with you soon due to your mismanagement. We have had to make daily calls that went for at least 1 hour and some days there were several. To the point, we lost 2 jobs due to we couldn’t quote/go to meetings as we were in damage control mode dealing with your lack of dealing. Our CPanel ( which we only moved due to the great advice of your caring and helpful staff stating it would streamline our business and cope with the number of sites we build) We were also advised to do so as your server was so slow to load it was taking twice the time to run our business. Well, anyway the CPANEL was also hacked by malware bots and there goes 6 months of work! There was no support from your team or even the slightest genuine motivation to help remedy this. And Go, Daddy, If you send me a message ill give you our account number and you will see the hours and hours of calls notes blah blah blah."
Just purchase an SSL certificate and my website is not hosted with go daddy they cannot help me install it and it has been over 30 days so they won't refund BUT when I purchase it DID NOT said anything about that! Very poor consumer service.
"Sold me a hosting package that was incompatible with the platform i was using, then locked me out of cpanel, for two months rendering it useless, had to move to another provider costing thousands due to being locked out, finally got moved over then then godaddy said they would not refund me any of the money I paid for hosting I can not use."
"We have a WordPress website that is hosted with GoDaddy Managed Wordpress service. In our plan, we have an allowance for two websites. each website has a staging website.
The plan was to use one website as dev\test and the other one as a staging production. so we will do dev -> test -> staging - > prod. and we were happy to buy the managed WordPress plan because we didn't want all the headache around the WordPress admin. BUT THE SAD REALITY IS:
1. I will start with the interaction with them:
a. Every time you call Godday you are expected to s... Read more

pend at least 17 - 30 minutes until someone picks up the phone. b. every time speak with someone, you need to tell your story again and again - they seem to ignore all the notes that other tiers noted, even if it was in the same conversation. c. they don't return call you back if the call disconnected and you need to call again (it's a bit frustrating when on the phone with them 60 min - 90 min) and obviously you need to wait again, tell the story again and so on... 2. You can't push from one website to another website - that means we need to do the development, testing and staging on the staging web site. 3. The admin doesn't allow you to restore the staging website from backup, that means any issue in the development you need to call them and this is painful (Point #1) 4. Pushing the Staging to the production in our case failed, so we had to have manually pushed by the backend team, this had to be done 5 times and every time they say the process can take up to 1 hour so if you still have an issue then call us again (point #1-5 again). 5. during the attempts to push manually the Staging to the production they screwed the staging also, so for two days we didn't know what is going with all our work."
"Wow - didn't think this could happen, paid for everything spent a heap of time getting my domain, building my website, paying for additional emails, setting them up THEN get an automated response saying to prove my credit card is mine. Uploaded my license which has my abbreviated name i.e. Chris vs Christos. They cancelled my site Did not respond to my emails only via automated agents. Lost my domain, lost my email, lost my images, lost all my work and not even a hint of support."
"Getting started with Godaddy was very easy and quite inexpensive. But over the following year as the introductory period ended it became quite expensive. When I tried to cut back on some of my products my attempts were reversed on their web site. After much frustrating discussion with their Support team I was convinced that I had to set up Two-Step Verification so I could securely cancel my products and stop the auto renew charges. I did that and cancelled all my auto-renewals. During the past month I have been inundated with emails about my au... Read more

to-renewals because somehow one of them has been turned back on. To turn it off I have to log in using the Two-Step Verification but the phone number for the 2nd step code has been changed to one that isn't mine. So I can't log in and their Support team say they can't either. They require me to email them a copy of photo ID with my face clearly shown, my signature, date of birth and so on before they will assist me. This is a huge security risk from a company who can't prevent my phone number from being changed on my ""secure"" account and I won't do it. So they intend to continue auto-renewing my account indefinitely. The only way to prevent them is to cancel my credit card. What a hassle!!"
"I rang up to renew my domain name and it was canceled by the Consultant.

Then I was sold an SSL Certificate and NOT TOLD at time of purchase that I needed to get a Web Developer to code it onto my website. Therefore, I have paid for something that has been of ABSOLUTELY NO USE to me!

The Consultants are paid an incentive to sell you additional products and services. They induce you to buy products, without giving you all of the information you need in order to gain benefit from what you have purchased.

In other words my experience has been that they apply deceptive conduct to induce the purchase of products/services."
"I have now finally cancelled all my Hosting services and SSL certificates on GoDaddy. I am running 2 VPS servers on Linode for the same cost ($25/month paid by the hour) as my one GoDaddy shared hosting! (I have not looked back - to get the same VPS on Godaddy would cost $41.98/month paid by the month if you can figure out how to turn off all the extras!)
The only thing I would use them for (and still do) is registering domain names which they seem to do an okay job at.

service automatically renewing (Money reclaimed but still several hundred $ per time!). The problems (Shared hosing): - Internal updates in GoDaddys broke all my Wordpress sites on a 6 monthly basis. This required nearly 20-40 hours to fix each time! (Support was NOT helpful in any way shape or form) - The hosing was slow. I don't know how many people there are per server but it must be a lot. - The 'Unlimited' features are a long way from Unlimited. In fact they are the very opposite! - The script timeouts seem to also apply to their own website. Trying to download my data took a very long time. With frequent drop outs. - The MySql server is slow and drops out. Trying to download large databases is very difficult!"
"Obscure interface with hidden billing path. Hard to find how to cancel a product.
When you find it, you may get one of these meaningless messages
""Don't worry, we won't take it personal:This product cannot be canceled at this time. Please contact our customer service team for more information.""
So you have to call them to sort out the issue when it should take a single click. I am closing my account once and for all."
"They are not an Australian company. They use Australian phone no.s but do not have a local presence in Australia. GoDaddy is the worst business experience we have ever had. Ruthless business practices. Videoblocks, (another US company!) made an unauthorised transaction on our card, so our bank had to cancel the card with a chargeback.

However, without any notification via email, text or phone, GoDaddy deleted our corporate website that runs an educational program because we were late for a m... Read more

onthly payment of $10! It was after a few days we found out. We have been their customer for years, yet we could not reason out with them. Please refer to the links below, and understand how dangerously deceptive, and ruthless, this company and its staff members are. Thousands of customers have had heavy losses because GoDaddy's business practices are one sided. Customer care is not in their radar. When I finally managed to get a hold of them, GoDaddy said they sent us three ""failed billing notices"" to our email before taking our website away. Firstly, no, we haven't had any such GoDaddy ""failed billing notices"" in our email, not even in our spam folder. And, yes, we do have three Domain Notifications for a domain we cancelled a long time ago, which has nothing to do with our website. Secondly, I learnt from GoDaddy staff yesterday, that they send these ""failed billing notices"" to existing customers from their marketing department and not from the billing department just so that these notices go to customers' spam folder so they will not know that their websites would be deleted and then GoDaddy demands a restoration fee of $250 under threat of destroying the website information. I allege this to be extortion. We respectfully asked them to do what's right by us. Most of their staff members are sadistic, and get a sick satisfaction when customers call in a panic after seeing their website disappeared. I had to research for hours to get their USA phone no.s and read reviews on USA Better Business Bureau. I then spent hours to get a hold of their staff just to gather what their practices are and why they would do such a bizarre thing. The first two put me on hold saying they were transferring me to a supervisor, and after half an hour or so I hung up realising they were dishonest and wanted me to tire of holding. The third person was mocking at me that it was their right to take our website because we didn't pay. The fourth person insisted, talking over me constantly, that they sent out notices even though I said we haven't received any. He condescendingly demanded that I deal with Gmail if the notices were in my Spam folder. The fifth person from billing dept said that so many customers have had my experience. I asked her, even though we haven't had any GoDaddy email notices sent to us, if it was the billing department that send out these ""failed billing notices"" they refer to, and she said no, it was the Marketing Department. She then said GMail is not good and that we should buy their product for email as its better than GMail and that their notices would not have gone to Spam folder if we had their product! She even discussed the cost of their email product with me. I persevered so I could get to the bottom of this scam for the sake of all Australian consumers. Please, fellow Australians, avoid them like the plague before you lose your precious website that is worth thousands of $$$$ and your good reputation, for the inadvertent delay of payment of a $10 subscription. Go to Singaporean companies. Very ethical, and legally safe: https://www.bbb.org/…/godaddycom-llc-1126-22000…/complaints… https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.godaddy.com"
I registered a business name with Australia Government which I took photo of time and that the fact that the domain.com was available. I then visited your website and typed it in to buy it for .99 cents only to be forced to call you to be advised it was just bought five minutes ago!! Instead of 99 cents it would be $112 but because it was listed for sale go daddy are sure they could secure it for me. outraged. scam. asked for management - tried again had when called back and have been blocked. no where to send complaints on your website. this is an outrage
"Hi we are a corporate client with over ten established websites
Go Daddy took our money to back up our sites, but failed to make the back ups
Subsequently 2 of our sites went down and the back ups could not be reinstated for obvious reasons.

I discovered they have no local Australian Premises and operate our of Arizona.

GoDaddy admitted liability to me and offered me free hosting for three years as compensation but the sites will cost us about $8000 to recreate

Despite having a team of developers (they did not offer to rebuild the sites at their cost

Beware of this organisation as in my view it has no ethics and does not act honourably when confronted with an error on its part"
"What happened to GoDaddy? Customer service was excellent. Now it’s extremely poor. GoDaddy demanded a copy of a government issued ID to “verify credit card details” but not one of their policies stipulates how that information would be safeguarded, and how they would anonymise any information post verification. Two emails written in simple English were dismissed by the “customer service” representative. A request for a senior customer service manager to contact me was ignored. A formal complaint was lodged with the Bureau of Consumer Protection. Once my current hosting expires, I’m taking my business elsewhere."
"They provide poor service. Can't contact them, over 30 minutes on hold. Gave up. No matter how many times I cancelled the auto renewal payment, they keep stealing my money. It took way too much pain to cancel their service for it to not be intentional. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
It was easy to create and designate a domain name for my google site.
"I have received excellent service, the website has worked flawlessly and set up was very easy."
"I've appreciated my experience with GoDaddy and looking forward to continuing the relationship. I recommend my clients to change their services to also use GoDaddy. What's important to me is reliability, flexibility and support. GoDaddy offer all those services and therefore allows me to get on with what I do best and it saves me both time and money. Thank you!"
"Does anyone know what is going on, my website is down. Anyone else experiencing this issue?"
So easy to setup.
"If only there was an option of zero stars. I purchase an upgraded server as well as the migration service for approx $99. The sales agent told me during the chat that the migration would take only 72 hours. Massive lie, the terms say 7-10 days. OK, so we wait 10 days, I check in regularly, and still no migration. I've chatted and spoken over the phone with various agents. I've heard everything from it might take up to 20 days, to, it will be done in 2 hours. Either they are comfortable with lying outright, or they are running a circus and don't know up from down. I am so tired of wasting my time with them. DO NOT USE for anything beyond domain registration. In the end I DID NOT 'get assistance from the tech team', what actually happened is I cancelled the migration & requested a refund. Today was the 11th day and the agents could still not tell me the status of migration nor why we had 2 hours of site outage. It seems that telling tall tales is part of company culture."

The online chat i had with one of your assistants was absolutely confusing.
I spoke to Hannah at Godaddy Guides | Sales & Support. She had an immensely warm and friendly approach. professional and happy to help. we sorted out all of my issues on the first call. I'm a happy customer.

"Unable to solve account problem, no refunds without wiping out your website, no changes without wiping out your website, no contact afterwards despite promises.

Not a brilliant start by any measure."
I've had to phone the company a few times and they have always been extremely helpful. The last call operator Zara was very friendly and sorted everything promptly. A+ good work Zara and godaddy

"To whom it may concern,

In my opinion you guys could have been more flexible.

I made a spelling mistake when I was registering my domain in order to correct it and I gave you guys a call at the same day to sort it out for me.
The service provided over the phone was great, however, I had to pay extra $27.45 to get it sorted for me.
I think to exceed costumers expectations you could have done it for free as it was a simple spelling mistake.

Best regards,

Diego Turela de Lima"
"Bought their domain broker service. Waited about 2 months only to be told they couldn't establish communication with the domain owner. Then I had to spend about 2 hours trying to explain godaddy customer service why I'm asking for a refund.

Got the refund in the end but they didn't want to untill I showed them the screenshots of emails I sent before that were never answered by godaddy."
Roy was very helpful today and it was great working with him to get our questions answered!
Awesome customer service!
I like working with GoDaddy because they are always willing to help customers.
"Fantastic customer service.  Any time I call everyone is pleasant, friendly, and very knowledgeable.  Can't go wrong with GoDaddy!"
Every time I try to log in it takes me to another screen to pay more.
"I had a GREAT experience with GoDaddy Website support last night! It was the first time I have used their helpline, and the service was fantastic. They answered the phone promptly, he stayed on the line and explained things without making me feel like an idiot, connected with other staffers and resolved ALL the problems. I recommend GoDaddy Website Builder to all my friends and family. It is affordable, intuitive, and has all the tools most people need. Now I can say they have GREAT customer support!"
Great job thanks
Great service and helpful when starting out.
This is my first time setting up a website and yes I've been a little frustrated but they are available for live chat to walk you through it. At first it was like getting driving directions and didn't want to do it but now I'll be chatting all the time. The price is right too.
"There are many providers available to choose among. What set GoDaddy apart from the rest for me is the SERVICE. The customer service reps are attentive, patient and helpful. When setting up my blog I had many questions about the templates and how to configure them to meet my needs. The reps were great in offering suggestions and workarounds."
Many things are not explained where a non tech person can understand them. Getting help is about Impossible imposable.
"Always easy to find help, feels that customer service is happy to do their job, that makes things easier and I feel that I made the right decision."
I made a typo while trying to visit facebook and ended up on a Fake Virus page that said I have a virus and need to call a number to get it fixed. I did a whois search and found that was a godadddy domain. I reported this to godaddy and they still haven't removed it (it's been 3 days since I reported it). As I was visiting a page that they have control over I feel that I'm a customer and have written this review of their service (or lack of).
"Why not dealing with Godaddy
I move my website to they claim worlds first class hosting for website like no others , they promised they server very protected and website will be very secure , on of the pages with infected with some virus's and they made promise they system will fix the problem ( that was July 2016 ) and since then I made god knows only many calls and every time a new operator and different solutions!!

Until my son the website wasn't even uploaded to google that shows how's Godaddy & Sitelock operate they make you purchasing product but they don't action nothing in early December I received notification from Godaddy the site was clear from all the viruses and protected by Sitelock and after checking was only google took of the warning but the site invisible ITS NOT THERE and between early December 2016 to 2017 February I COULD NOT TAKE AN ANSWER FROM GODADDY , Sitelock they answer don't worry about the previous product it's NOT GOOD but if you buy another more expensive one we might fix it , in simple way these guys they'll give you nothing in wrighting except the receipts . I decided to get rid of the website after I spent in Totall of $3000 !! I was very upset and yesterday after all the bad experience with GODADDY I called I made my point how much and how many times they failed to deliver any of they empty promises the so called Supervisor he finally agreed to close my account and he claim to delete my website while didn't exsist any way but to keep me bitter he did not show any other interest beside closing and deleting my costly investment with no apology or anything ."

to be untrue. It's bad, but hey, it happens sometimes.
But then to refuse to return the customer's money? No excuse. it left a large credit sitting in my account that I am supposed to use up somehow.
Worse than that, when I tried to transfer that customer credit to another account, they refused outright. The reason? Simple: ""We can't."" I see. And why is that? ""Because we can't."" Yes, I heard that the first time. What's the reason you can't? ""We can't do that. I don't know how to say it any clearer, Sir. We just can't."" Yes, I've heard you say that 3 times already, but I haven't yet heard a reason why. ""There's no way to do that on our system.""
Got it, folks? To steal a phrase from an old TV show, apparently when you try to do something at GoDaddy, Computer Say ""No."" You might as well kiss your money goodbye...

"free lunch, drinks everyday , health was good, great work environment, management was good until i changed bosses. like how it was close to my house not a long drive to go to work"
Good Web based tech job for beginners. I enjoyed the managers that i worked with during my time. Had a great nerdy culture with some competitive drive vs the other teams at the workplace. Hardest part of the job was the endless amount of calls and the occasional customer that nothing could be done for whatsoever causing headaches all around. My favorite part of working at Bluehost was the opportunities i had to learn more about web development to help me get more tech experience i didn't previously have. The biggest thing however that i learned while there was to not rely on pushing for up selling customer to just up sell as a company they changed their views a bit to late in my time there switching from needing to make money to giving customers the best experience they could find. In their current status i honestly couldn't say weather i would work there again or recommend it would be better to find out for yourself.
"The work itself was okay, Customers weren't too hard to deal with, and I really enjoyed the motivation I exhibited trying to get better while working here.
The only downfall is that management was sort of hit and a miss. You had some good ones and some bad one."
fun and good job until they laid everyone off and no longer had a job to go to. they closed because of a move they decided on only 3 months of being on job.
This is one of the best jobs that I have ever had. They love and take care of their people as they know that is what keeps the doors open. They also like to promote from within.
"No where to go here. They dont develop their employees and there aren't many other jobs to advance to.
They work you hard. There is a lot of micro management here."
"Loved the individual brand I was at, Corporate was an entirely different story. There was no concern for our opinions, or over all well being, compensation etc... Just make the corporate machine run that is all."
"Loved working for Bluehost as a company, but the corporate (Endurance) influence was toxic. Compensation was competitive and benefits were amazing - I find myself comparing all other potential employers to the BH standard."
Constantly changing environments and expectations. They decided that since they could pay employees less in AZ that they would fire everyone who worked for them in UT and then did their best to fire off as many people as possible to save on severances.
"BlueHost hires some of the best people in their fields. Although you tackle difficult problems, you are working with really smart people that you can learn from. They help you balance home and work life with flexible time off and have opportunities to connect with co-workers through video games, pinball and lunches."
"I love this company, and would recommend anyone to work for BlueHost. Great benefits, great incentives, great ""fringe benefits"", they have the best tools, if you are a small business owner looking to build a website."
"I troubleshooted existing customer with Email, DNS lookup, Trace routing, or SSL Config inquiries. After assisting the customer, we would review the client's company's website and help them look a little more professional with an edge over the rest of their competitors or gave pointers on how to make their site more safe and manageable up selling them various products and services. If they had a product or service we'd review with them how it was working out for them, and do a side by side with them if they were utilizing the functions or utilities of that product or service as best they could for what they needed from it.
The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the client's web site take off and their company grow or get up to that level of sophistication within their industry."
Loved the people I worked with. It was a fun environment to work in . I was able to go above and beyond for customer and other people I worked with were willing to work with me to help customer quickly.
"This is your typical call center. No fun, only focused on stats and not well being of employees. My manager was great and we remain friends till this day, that was the only thing keeping me there."
"Little to no direction from upper management. Everything is reactive.
Management is old school ""do this thing now, don't ask questions, or else"". Great at being bosses, terrible at being effective leaders.
Workplace culture is fine. People keep to themselves.
Hardest part of my job is dealing with upper management.
Most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
No pay for upgrades and selling company product. Manager was there 10-times the whole summer. Expected to do job duties that were not in the interview or had anything to do with my Job Title such as Chargebacks. Got screamed at on every call which dealt with Chargebacks. Chargeback Specialist were non-responsive on helping the Customer Service team so it would leave Customers on the phone for 20-40 minutes with brief breaks. The communication and organization of this company is the worst I have ever seen. Horrible environment and employees hated this company!
"Customer service for individuals and small businesses
Learned a lot from working with customers and technology everyday
Management is great but can still improve at the top level
Culture is great"
"The people were great. The hardest part of this job was wanting to help the clients more, and we were unable to do so. I wasn't at this occupation for very long as I didn't feel like I was helping clients that were calling in for assistance. We had to refer them back to their website/hosting and walk them through how to do things. We weren't able to assist clients further than that."
F*** bluehost. They're a s*** company who hired a big group of us full well knowing that they'd lay us off in a month. The training we got was a joke and any attempt in continued learning was met with derision.
"I loved working at Bluehost. The training was great. The atmosphere was fun. And the supervisors were on the side of the customers, which made my job easy. About a month into the position, I was being trained as a server professional, which I did until the end of my tenure with Bluehost."
"Responsiveness is great.
Their offers are attractive to customers which makes them respond faster.
The method of money back is amazing and the bonuses the affliaters got is great"
"Getting started on building your first business website can be daunting. Sure, you could just communicate with your customers via Facebook or another social media platform, but if you're serious about doing business online, you'll want to take the plunge and sign up for a top-notch web hosting service. Bluehost (a PC Mag Business Choice winner) does a good job of balancing price and features for businesses that need a bit of hand-holding, while also offering plenty of options to experienced administrators. Still, Bluehost lacks Windows-based servers and the month-to-month pricing we like to see on shared plans.Shared Web HostingShared web hosting is good for people who want an online presence and don't expect a high traffic volume. The upside? It's cheap web hosting. The downside? Your website shares server resources with other sites, so your site's performance can be affected if one of its server mates experiences a traffic surge.As mentioned above, Bluehost doesn't offer month-to-month shared web hosting options. Instead, it requires you to sign up for an annual plan. If you sign up for a two-year or three-year plan, you get discounts. If you commit to staying put for three years, the service's $3.95 per month rate is attractive. Those who don't want lengthy commitments will probably prefer HostGator's month-to-month options.Note: Bluehost&mdash;like many other web hosting services&mdash;has introductory prices that are discounted from its normal hosting cost. Our reviews don't consider those deeply discounted fees, which are designed to get you in the door. Instead, we list the true price that kicks in when the introductory period concludes.The Basic shared hosting package (from $7.99 per month with a one-year contract) includes a free domain name that you can keep as long as you use Bluehost, free domain name transfer, 50GB of storage, unlimited monthly data transfers, and just five email addresses. The Plus package (starting at $10.99 per month with a one-year contract) adds an antispam tool, as well as unlimited storage and mailboxes. The Choice Plus package (starting at $14.99 per month with a one-year contract) comes with domain privacy so that you can mask your physical location for enhanced security. The Pro plan (starting at $23.99 per month with a one-year contract) has all of Choice Plus' features, plus adds a free, dedicated IP address.HostGator  , our Editors' Choice for shared hosting, gives small- and medium-sized businesses room to expand their web presences. The Linux- or Windows-based Hatchling plan (starting at $10.95 per month) offers unlimited disk space, monthly data transfers, and email addresses, plus support for one domain and third-party applications, such as content management systems and e-commerce platforms. HostGator's Baby plan (starting at $11.95 per month) builds on the Hatchling offering by adding unlimited domains. The top-tier Business plan (starting at $16.95 per month) includes highly specialized options, such as a free toll-free phone number and a private SSL certificate. HostGator has a well-rounded shared web hosting package.VPS Web HostingIf you need more power, expect high traffic volumes, or have specific compliance requirements that prevent you from using shared servers, Bluehost's virtual private server (or VPS) options are worth considering. It's like shared hosting in that your site shares server resources with other sites, but there are two big differences: VPS hosting has far fewer sites on a server, and the provider guarantees you a particular amount of server resources. A VPS-hosted site can take a Reddit hit and keep on ticking.Bluehost offers three tiers of Linux-based VPS hosting, ranging from the $29.99 per month Standard (30GB of solid-state storage, 2GB of memory, and unlimited monthly data transfers) to the $119.99 per month Ultimate (120GB of SSD storage, 8GB of memory, and unlimited monthly data transfers). As with the shared web hosting plans, VPS hosting plans include discounts for longer-term contracts. Unfortunately, Bluehost doesn't offer Windows-based VPS.Those are attractive plans, but Hostwinds&mdash;the Editors' Choice for VPS hosting&mdash;beats out Bluehost with packages that include 18.5GB of RAM, unlimited email, unlimited monthly data transfers, and Linux- or Windows-based server options. Don't underestimate the importance of a Windows server option. If you plan to build (or migrate) a site built on an ASP.NET framework, you'll appreciate Hostwinds' Windows-based VPS offerings.Dedicated Web HostingDedicated hosting is a powerful form of web hosting that gives your site full server resources. If you expect huge traffic numbers, dedicated hosting is the only way your site will handle the Internet's rigors. Bluehost has many dedicated server configurations, too. The servers start at $109 per month and can be outfitted with a Linux operating system and up to 1TB of hard drive space, 16GB of RAM, and 15TB of data transfers per month&mdash;the same specs as HostMonster.Those are solid numbers, but AccuWeb  &mdash;the PCMag Editors' Choice for dedicated web hosting&mdash;one-ups Bluehost with a choice of Linux or Windows operating systems. That Windows server option is important for those who build their sites using Microsoft's sitebuilding tools.WordPress Web HostingWordPress is the content management system that powers a good portion of sites on the web. It's easy to use, and has a thriving theme and plug-in ecosystem for expanding your site's functionality. If you're looking to create a WordPress-powered website, consider Bluehost's three Linux-based packages: Basic, Plus, and Choice Plus.Basic (starting at $7.99 per month) lets you host one website, and includes 50GB of SSD storage, a free SSL certificate, and a free domain for a year. Next up the ladder is the Plus plan (from $10.99 per month), which includes unlimited site hosting and unlimited SSD storage. The top-tier Choice Plus plan (starting at $14.99 per month) tosses in CodeGuard Basic backup software.Recently, Bluehost introduced a new WordPress hosting category: WordPress Pro. Available in three tiers, WordPress Pro is a managed WordPress offering that gives your site's back end the white-glove treatment, and includes SEO, social media, and email marketing tools. WordPress Pro's three plans (Build, Grow, and Scale) all boast unlimited site hosting, monthly data transfers, domains, subdomains, and storage. WordPress Pro accounts also come with staging areas to test sites before they go live to the web. Build, Grow, and Scale start at $29.99 per month, $39.99 per month, and $59.99 per month, respectively.The Build plan comes with 100 free WordPress themes, daily scheduled backups, malware detection and removal, and domain privacy protection. The Grow plan uses the Build plan as a foundation and adds SEO tools, 10GB of video compression, and live ticket support. Scales tops all WordPress Pro plans by adding live chat support, unlimited video compression, PayPal integration, and unlimited backups and restore.Bluehost doesn't require you to install the content management system, as it comes preinstalled. Once you're logged into WordPress, you can create posts, pages, and galleries as you would with any other self-hosted WordPress site.Bluehost's WordPress plans are quite good, but the Linux-based A2   remains the PCMag Editors' Choice for WordPress hosting. A2 offers four excellent WordPress hosting tiers, starting at $7.99 per month, offers unlimited storage and monthly data transfers across the board. The plans top out with the $24.46 per month Managed package that includes unlimited databases and websites. You also get a free SSL certificate with all plans, too.For more on the fantastically popular content management system, you should read How to Get Started With WordPress.Reseller HostingIf you're looking to get into the web hosting business, but you don't want to deal with infrastructure matters, check out Bluehost's reseller hosting packages. The four plans, starting at $18.99 per month, boast unlimited email, website hosting, and cPanel creation across the board. The servers are of the Linux variety, but Bluehost doesn't supply them with unlimited storge and monthly data transfers at each tier, as the Editors' Choice Hostwind does with its offerings. On the upside, Bluehost lets you apply your own branding to the servers you rent, and it also supplies 24/7 tech support.Lacks Cloud HostingWith cloud hosting, the resources that your site needs to operate are shared across multiple servers. The benefits? You can scale resources in real time, as your site isn't limited to physical server constraints.Bluehost, unlike many other web hosts PCMag reviews, does not offer cloud hosting. If you want to explore cloud hosting, I suggest checking out DreamHost or 1&amp;1 Ionos. The former is the Editors' Choice for standard cloud hosting, while the latter is the Editors' Choice for enterprise-level cloud hosting.Site CreationBluehost has a lot of tools for building sites, filtering spam, managing email, collecting site statistics, and managing domains. For building a website, you can use the WordPress content management platform or Weebly (an excellent website-builder), upload files using FTP or File Manager, or use the goMobi Mobile Web builder if you bought the add-on.Weebly's drag-and-drop functionality let me quickly build an attractive page complete with slideshows, contact forms, social media links, and more. Weebly's free version gives you basic functionality (you can create six pages and add custom HTML), but upgrading to the $8.99 per month Professional tier offers even more flexibility (custom themes, password protected pages, and more). Check out the PCMag Weebly review for a deeper dive.You can also go to the Mojo Marketplace to download other content-management systems or site builders. It's an entirely separate interface, but if you want to expand your site's capabilities, the marketplace is a good place to start. Using Bluehost's Mojo Marketplace is a similar to running sister-site iPage's marketplace.E-CommerceYou can grab email-marketing tools such as DaDa Mail (starting at $34.95 per year), software that lets you send email-based newsletters to a subscriber list. For an online store or the ability to accept payments, you can get e-commerce applications such as Magento, ShopSite (for shopping cart software), and TransFirst payment gateway. With Magento, I was able to create an attractive store by dragging and dropping website elements. Magento has more flexibility than ShopSite, but if you aren't looking for an elaborate online storefront, ShopSite's simpler interface may get you up and running faster. For small businesses, that time saved may be worth it.I also like the fact that Bluehost supports PostgreSQL along with the more popular MySQL. This means I'm not limited to installing software that runs only with MySQL.Security FeaturesBluehost's security features are pleasantly surprising. It offers three antispam tools&mdash;Apache Spam Assassin, Spam Experts, and Spam Hammer&mdash;as well as hotlink protection. You can also create filters for email accounts and users, password-protect directories, create IP address blacklists, and manage private keys and digital certificates. I'm always pleased to see secure shell (SSH) access, because it means administrators have a secure way of accessing specific configuration files.I'm impressed that Bluehost offers CloudFlare, which enhances performance and security features. If you want SSL on your site, or you are worried about distributed denial of service attacks against your site, CloudFlare is worth considering.Good UptimeWebsite uptime is a vital element of the web hosting experience. If your site goes down, clients or customers will be unable to find you or access your products or services.For this testing, I use a website monitoring tool to track my test sites' uptime over a 14-day period. Every 15 minutes, the tool pings each of my websites and sends me an email if it is unable to contact a site for at least one minute. The data revealed that Bluehost is extremely stable. In fact, Bluehost briefly went down just once in the two-week period. You can count on Bluehost to be a dependable web host.Customer ServiceBluehost offers 24/7 telephone support, online web chat, a ticket-based system, and a knowledgebase&mdash;another way Bluehost is similar to HostMonster.I tested Bluehost's web chat on a weekday afternoon to ask about the differences between regular Web hosting and optimized WordPress hosting. The rep quickly fielded my question. He stated that optimized WordPress web hosting has automated site backups and is designed for highly trafficked WordPress sites. I am satisfied with his response.I called the phone support system the next morning to ask a representative about how to import my WordPress.com setup into Bluehost. A person came to my assistance in just a few seconds, and the representative walked me through the steps. That's another win for Bluehost support.Bluehost's hosting packages come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, which is standard fare in the web hosting space. That said, DreamHost bests it with an impressive 97-day money back guarantee.A Capable Web HostBluehost is a respectable and highly stable web host that makes setting up a website a breeze. The features and the user experience are similar to stablemate HostMonster's, and the only reason I would suggest picking Bluehost over HostMonster is because of the former's array of security options. If you are looking for a web host that's easy to get set up and running, however, you get much more for your money from DreamHost or HostGator, two Editors' Choice award-winning services, both of which are feature rich and simple to use.For more on getting started online, read our tips on how to create a website.

I was initially told that they would be able to transfer the SSL within a couple of hours. When that didn’t happen I was told it would be 24 more hours. After that all they would say is that, “it’s in the hands of our experts”, but that they could not give me an estimate of when it would be completed. Yesterday I communicated with a supervisor who told me that the problem was that their “reburn machine” is broken and that their tech development team is very busy and he would put a priority on my support request but he could not give me an estimate for when the site would be up. Our website has now been down for 8 days and I don’t want to think about how many potential donors we have lost. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give Bluehost a zero for technical support.

I moved all my domains to namecheap and it was so much better, less headache and no more waste of time and money.

I bought their highest cloud hosting package yet it has many broken things inside, the customer support use to be local to Chicago, and now they are from India with absolutely no clue what they have in hand. Just to get a simple thing sorted out, I have to spend minimum of 4 hours escalating things to different departments and still things do not work like they should. Their reliability in terms of up-time remains good, but rest things are broken, despite writing them plenty of times nothing was rectified and was promised every time for a fix soon. When you contact them as a new customer, just look at their promises to support everything you throw at them, once you become a customer, same support replies will reverse with a simple reply - sorry we do not support this script/feature.
They won't be getting my recommendation and renewal for sure once my account expires in January 2020.

They are good. Used them for few hosting and great for php. They are slightly overpriced.
They have great pricing and unlimited on everything we need. Great for php and user friendly interface.
"After having a dismal experience with an understaffed, poorly managed, overpriced hosting service, BlueHost has been a breath of fresh air. The service has been solid and the price reasonable. 24/7 telephone service and the techs have been pretty good. If they don't know the answer or need to refer the problem farther up the chain, they'll get back with you in a couple of hours max. Their administrative tools are pretty good, too, and they include two different site stat programs for free."
I have had several accounts with Blue Host for the past few years. I currently have about 28 domains hosed on two account. At one point the server I was using was getting over loaded. They did a great job getting my accounts move to a better server with almost no downtime. I have talked to the tech support several times and they have always been helpful. Give them a try!
"I have been using them for over 5 years now for my own site and several other projects. The support they have offered has always been great as I always speak with live techs that know what they are doing. I build a lot of applications with PHP and as the user above states they are great for it. Their RoR setup started off really shakey and even now has minimal support but functions fine. I was glad when they went ""unlimited"". I bought into shell access and run my own server processes in the background and I have never had any problems with that. Bandwidth always was pretty great even when I went over seas."
"Bluehost is great! Use them for all my hosting needs. Support is great - rarely have to wait on hold and techs are pretty knowledgeable. The only issue I have with them is that they don't scale very well. They have a ""High CPU server"" for a couple of extra bux, but they don't offer anything yet in the way of private servers... Overall it's a pretty good experience.."

We use blue host primarily because of their wordpress integration. They are very good with wordpress hosting and have modules already in place to make your job easier. I can say they are by far the best i've worked with when it comes to hosting a blog.
"Good hosting company, decent support. Had couple of sites hosted with them."
Bluehost is awesome. I've used a lot of hosting services over the years and these guys are best. Great tools. Always up. Super support. Fair price.
"Believe it or not, I have been with BH since the beginning practically. I have always had great customer service. In the time i have been with them, my site has gone down once. I have always received courteous and informative emails about any issues that arise and to boot they are reasonable in pricing. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else at this point. I believe customer service is #1 and so do they. It's real nice to have a relationship like that."
"If you're hosting a Wordpress blog, you can't pick a better host."
"I've been using them for years. I've had over 20 different websites hosted with them and it's always been great. Their automatic installs of CMSs, especially Wordpress, are awesome."
I love Bluehost. Pretty much unlimited everything. I'm hosting multiple sites under one account. It's very easy to do anything.
"After bouncing around between hosts a few years ago, I moved to Bluehost. Very happy. Have only used support a couple of times, but both times had quick response and solutions."
I have had the best experience with this company. We used to have GoDaddy and BlueHost is so much better. Customer is the best I have ever had. Uptime has never been a problem with them.
"We use them as a simple host for our 5 public internet sites but I much prefer Novahost, which I use for my personal sites and side hosting business."
Customer service is top-notch; you actually speak to competent people based in the US. Lots of features for a great price. This is a top-notch web hosting company.
"I have used them for over year and they have a great price and full-featured CPanel management. the only drawback is on my shared host they need to reboot the server a few times a month for various reasons. Nothing critical on my website, but I'd rather get notices that they are fixing the server, rather than users tell me that the site is down for 30minutes."
"Definitely prefer BlueHost to most hosting vendors. Great pricing, Wonderful competent support personnel. I have used them for over 2 years. We are so pleased we are going to be reselling as an affiliate."
"Love BlueHost, it's become the only hosting site I use. Competitive pricing, very helpful customer support, an intuitive control panel and good tracking features. I highly recommend it."
They have an excellent support team and their servers are fast. cPanel is ok too.
"Since I do not need a .ca or a hosting site located in Canada right now, I chose Bluehost over any other web hosting providers because of its high ratings, great reviews, and availability of video tutorials from Youtube. I also spent 40 minutes with their live chat and the rep was very patient answering my basic questions. I got their plan at 3.95 per month for 3 years and it's awesome. I would highly recommend it."
"My wife found Bluehost about 5 years ago, she needed SQL for her website and she got soo much more! We love the scripts and webpage templates. She puts a lot of time in the details of her websites, but anyone can get a nice fully functional page up in just a few minutes. We have stuck with Bluehost because of the Joomla, and Wordpress support. Email, Sitebuilder, and Domain Management/renewal. We think it is a great fit for the organizations we support and host there."
"I used Bluehost as the provider for a previous employer's WordPress site. Support is excellent and very responsive... both phone support and online chat. They also partner with very reputable third party companies to help with website moves and integration. The overall up-time, performance and data integrity of this service are world class. I would definitely use them again for future corporate web hosting."
"I cannot say enough positive comments about Bluehost. As others have said, Bluehost is very responsive via phone support. I have great disdain for online chat support and have never used it, thus I can't speak to its quality, but I would expect it to be great. The few times I've had technical questions, I could either search for the answer online and maybe/maybe not get the proper answer. Or I could just phone Bluehost and ask them. When I do call them, I've never gotten the feeling the technician on the other end was thinking ""Is this guy serious? Leave me alone with your simple questions"". I'll happily renew my contract with them for hosting my website, and I may just switch from my current domain registrar to Bluehost when that contract is up for renewal."

re what the heck I'm talking about), stays on the phone until the problem is solved and offers excellent advice on things I might want to do to make things work better. And they teach me things as they do it. I've even had techs work on a problem and actually call me back an hour or so later to tell me they fixed it! In fact, even though BH tech support does not cover application support (i.e. Wordpress, Joomla, etc.) they usually help me anyway if it is in any way related to how that app uses the server (and sometimes even if it's not).
I've been on other review sites where it's obvious people are paid to trash Blue Host (and presumably other hosting services -probably a good living for ""Kevin"" in Bangladesh). However I've been with Blue Host since 2005 -and my experience has been consistently excellent throughout that time. If some of these boneheads were real, then what they say would be real and in almost ten years of using Blue Host you'd think I might have, at one time or another, seen evidence of their complaints. I have not.
I also signed up for the affiliate program. I don't do websites professionally, but setting up a Wordpress site is so easy my dog can do it. I do it for a couple of people a year and, at 65 bucks a pop, it paid my entire hosting fee for years until I moved to VPS a few months ago. Essentially I've had almost ten years of free hosting -with the best tech support I have ever experienced.
I've hosted between 4 and 10 websites on my account from Worpress to Tikiwiki CMS. I run listserves, sit on some domains and set up a number of e-mail accounts for clients and friends. I'm not a programmer, just a power user and I find these folks perfect for my level of knowledge (or lack thereof).
I would definitely recommend Blue Host-and in fact have and will continue to do for as long as tech support retains it's high standard of excellence.

"I have really enjoyed hosting with BlueHost.
They are one of the bigger hosting companies out there but they still do a good job with the attention to customer service detail.
I have a small wordpress blog (100 to 150 visits/day) and it runs just fine on a shared account. If you have a very large site with thousands of visitors you may want to look at another host that provides dedicated or virtual private servers. Pretty sure Bluehost does not offer these services.
I signed up for the annual billing, not sure if you can do monthly. It is a good service so I would rather pay once than have to see the charge every month."
"When I first started looking for web hosting several years ago I was expecting a huge hit in immediate traffic from another site. I called their sales department and they worked with me so thoroughly on just my first call that I became more confident they would be able to deliver what I needed.
looking back I feel relieved that I made a good choice with them. I only had their shared server ($6.95) plan and it supported over a 25,000+ visitors a month in 2009 for me personally.
The WordPress feature is what I have mainly used with them. Unfortunately the first time I set it up WordPress manually, then I found simple scripts, and that saved me some trouble. I have set up several blogs with them and it’s been easy as pie.
Last note, their tech support when I started with them was pretty good. But over the past few years they’ve gotten way better. I call them before I install blogs or if I’ve screwed something up. They are super nice and work well with you.
Great features. haven’t used them all, but it seems like they have a lot. I recommend!"
"I got started with Bluehost then they suddenly suspended my account without warning, claiming that I had violated their terms of service. I had to get them on the phone to find out why, and they claimed it’s because the IP address I used when I signed up with came from a different country than my one my contact information is in. Guess what guys, it’s a WORLD WIDE Web and it’s OK to use IP addresses from different countries. Furthermore I read their Terms of Service and this is NOT a violation. This is seriously uncool that a hosting company would suspend a customer’s website WITHOUT checking with that customer FIRST about a concern! Especially when they’re in the wrong! I immediately moved my hosting elsewhere."
"I am moving away from Bluehost. They’re fine for small static sites but get any sort of community going and you’ll be throttled, even on pro. Lots of 504 errors, slow servers, weak technical support. If you’ve got a site that your income depends on, move away from Bluehost. I am."
"Bluehost is ideal for individuals, community groups and small to medium sized businesses. The servers run cPanel. If you do not know what this means, just know this is one of the most common control panels and most web developers are familiar with how it works. Which means most WordPress plugins will work with out any customization."

"I have used a lot of hosting companies for Wordpress, and Bluehost is one of the worst for up time. Forget whatever they tell you about how much time the servers stay up. In every hour on average the sites are in accessible for 10 mins. Currently the whole server is down now and has been for 48 hours, no domains no email! The company does not put out any service notices as is the norm in the industry, so all you have is a chat option with India, where a polite operator will tell your scripted responses about how important you are and then still won’t tell you anything other than,”our engineers are working on it”

"After migrating a few of my websites to Bluehost, nothing but problems have arisen.

1. ) On 1 PRO hosting account, I’ve had a website that was extremely slow, so after talking to them, they told me to upgrade to a dedicated VPS service and transfer the domain. They said it would be done in a matter of hours however it ended up taking 5 days of my website being offline without any improvement the website speed after the upgrade. When you start reaching out to their support you start realizing what a horrible company they are. The support staff is inexperienced and tell you different stories the whole time only to meet their quotes and making you spend more money but without actually helping you. I’ve lost more than a thousand dollars on this account and they do not reimburse you for it only of more of their hosting.
2. ) On my second account [SCAM ALERT] they took 3 of my websites offline with the reason that I’ve exceeded their usages limits (even though they say its unlimited usage) because of too big of database size and to upgrade to their PRO account:
    1. I was already on a PRO account
    2. After my developers checked everything it turned out I never exceeded the thresholds of 3000 tables or 5GB anyways.

This means they are just running a scam by taking your websites offline and then offering the solution to get them back online by paying more money to them. My websites were down for 6 days and I’ve lost hundreds of dollars in income, have to pay my developers for all the work they did and NONE of it will be refunded by Bluehost. I migrated everything away from them and they do not even want to refund my sign-up costs. It is a total scam run but incapable and money-grabbing people whereas the CEO of Endurance group Jeff Fox made $10.000.000 in 2019 alone and the CEO of Bluehost Suhaib Zaheer $2.300.000. Be aware you do not get scammed by them, I’ve warned you."

"I initially went to this company as it was getting good reviews in magazines - Techradr (USA) voted it the best hosting company.

However once I had signed up I am told that I have to most the work - getting details from previous host (GoDaddy), contact Nominet, and do a load of other things, some of the instructions were confusing and incorrect. After all that they tell me that they cannot transfer a UK domain as it was against company policy. GoDaddy were far more helpful (but expensive which is why I was looking around). I asked for a refund but received £30 less than I paid. I was shocked to see 84% giving a one star rating - thought that I would be the only one."

Great support and very helpful staff. Quick loading.
"Everyone I have spoken to cares about my situation no matter big or small. They do not give you attitude or make you feel like your a burden like some companies. They actually listen, and work out the issues. They are awesome!"
We've been using Bluehost for years. They are outstanding in taking care of their customers and we recommend them to our clients who need similar services with their businesses.
"In a world of dizzying technological change, it is wonderful to have a foundational service I can count on year after year."
"For over fifteen years, BlueHost has made a name for itself by providing a low-cost solution that delivers for its customers. Bluehost has been rated as a mid range web hosting provider. "
An absolute nightmare. My CPanel experience was not good. Don&#039;t get duped by their BBB rating or affiliate reviews. Customer service is hit or miss. When something goes wrong - they don&#039;t take responsibility. I cancelled the same day I signed up. Stay away!
"my favorite web hosting provider is bluehost - I have tried many other hosting options including one&#039;s like godaddy and verio, but after reading reviews of web hosting companies, it seemed like everyone really liked bluehost. They cheap, they have free domain name registration forever, great support, dedicated IP, and support all of the code that I need. I think pretty much everyone should be using them and I see no reason to go to other companies for hosting anymore. Plus, I have never really noticed any downtime from them."
"I&#039;ve been user of Bluehost for past 2 years. 1st year everything was going seems great but then suddenly my sites went down after every couple of weeks. They said my sites is being attacked of Malwares, and then they recommend to purchase their another security (SiteLock) services for keeping sites secure.

This is all bull***t, if thats the case than my sites could have went down from first month.

"These people would just take your site down without a reason. My site got hacked once, and they wanted me to buy their DOCTOR package of 200$ dollars to fix it. I somehow fixed it by spending a whole night. Few days went by and they took down my site again, this time without concrete reason. Their ultimate aim is to leech off you and grab as much money as possible. These f****** wasted 6 months of my hardwork.I want my 100$ refund"
"I used Blue Host for my site based on the novel I wrote called Isaac the Runner. They allow unlimited email accounts, space, hosting and file transfer. The prices are very cheap. If you want a web site, I&#039;d recommend Blue Host. That&#039;s about it."
"14 tech support phone calls in 2 weeks should be a red flag. Heck, it should be an arsenal....don&#039;t walk--RUN the other way as fast as you can. I host my personal email as well as business email and website through BlueHost and have for more than 3 years. Suddenly in the last year their serve tanked, as has my website and mail numerous times.
First let&#039;s talk about overall run time.  My website has been down more than 6 times in the last 8 months.  For a small business, that is a death sentence. It was even down the day I was scheduled for a redesign with my webmaster--great  My email went down several times as well, randomly, and I never knew it.  Then the biggie.
They shut off my accounts and turned off my website without notification.  It turned out they had expired. Well, I had called them more then 6 times, spending more than a total of 4 1/2 hours on hold trying to renew my accounts without ever being able to reach anyone.
So I renewed (don&#039;t ask me why), and they turned everything back on. The very next week I received a maintenance notice that they were doing &quot;emergency&quot; work on my server to protect my information and provide better service and my email would be down for 2 hours overnight. I awoke the next morning to NO email, past or present, so another 45 minute call for them to locate my emails and then reload them.
Let&#039;s talk about tech support.  I bought a new iPhone and changed from an android, so needed new settings.  That took 3 phone calls.  And then, after they reset my account, it took another 5 phone calls to get the correct settings for my iPad and iPhone, with each tech person telling me something different.  They told me they could only provide me one solution and if that didn&#039;t work, I had to call back. Really????
Tech support hold times average 30 minutes to 50 minute just to reach a live person.  They all will confidently provide you their working solution, but often it is incorrect, causing frustration and the need to start all over again.  There are no supervisors to talk with and they have removed any process by which you can file a complaint.
Bottom line--they were once in the top 10 hosting companies consistently and now are consistently omitted from the top ten list.  I think that says it all.

***Update 4/10/17 Email was once again totally wiped out. Took 47 minutes on hold, 19 minutes of issue &quot;resolution&quot; for them to tell me they didn&#039;t know what the issue was, but they could do a restore of the last backup from 3:23 am today.  So they did, and there were no emails since 4/2/17.  I tried to move service to another host company and BlueHost locked up emails.  Nothing is easy with this inept company."
I got transferred to their advanced domain support team. I was told they would contact me through email. A week later still no response and I cannot use the service I am paying for...
Good for your website hosting
"Bhavani was really an angel who is able to help me solve my issues after my attempts to fix my website. Without her quick and professional skills, i might still be struggling. Thank Bhavani."
"Tech support is horrible. I left Bluehost because of functionality issues. I was notified my renewal date was forthcoming, so I followed the cancellation instructions and migrated over to Hostgator (or so I thought). I updated my WordPress website and discovered that I hadn&#039;t been migrated? Hostgator went back to Bluehost and somehow during the transfer, I lost two weeks worth of work. I contacted Bluehost and the technician kept me on the line for over an hour &quot;not understanding&quot; my issue and informed me that only a technician and cancel an account which was contrary to everything instruction I read from Bluehost. I also asked for a refund and received a &quot;prorated&quot; refund. Who dropped the ball, Bluehost or Hostgator? Both, in my opinion but hands down Bluehost has the worst instance of customer service when the technician resort to lying."
"Back when I began hosting with BlueHost, they were the best.  Cheap. Crackerjack American kids answering your every question and setting you up with ease.  Compare that to now!  

Today, I wanted to cancel SiteBackup Pro, which I added a few months back because Bluehost suddenly deleted my 10 year old account with no backup because I was a few days late paying.  There was NO WARNING - - NO change of policy information -- because over the last decade, I&#039;ve forgotten to renew occasionally and it was never an issue.  So it was to my great shock that I lost over 10 years of emails, etc. with NO WARNING.  In fact, that&#039;s my property, BlueHost and maybe I should sue for damages...

So I added this worthless thing called sitebackup, but could never cancel it...

Today, I spent over 30 minutes chatting with some dumb ass from another country who (as typical) can&#039;t form a sentence.  He forced me to reset my password, then asked for it over the chat, then scolded me, after a 1/2 hour eventually took off the $2.99 charge.

I asked if there was another way to do this besides contacting customer support and he said no.

The funniest thing was, he asked me for my password and I gave it to him:  (no joke) . F###YouBlueHost!   (Replace the first four digits with the actual letters of course).

As soon as I can gather up my domains I will transfer them to another hosting service immediately. I don&#039;t need this abuse from a once American company."
"I have been with BlueHost for over ten years.  Has everything been perfect?  Of course not.  There have been a few hiccups here and there.  I don&#039;t know what those who give this less than a five are doing, but it is certainly not the BlueHost I have known over all these years.  Their tech support is outstanding.  Always helpful and knowledgeable.  Yes, there was a time where it took up to 30 plus minutes to connect.  That has mostly be solved now.  But, for me, I would rather rate for good service than to get someone who doesn&#039;t know that they are doing fast!  I have never had a problem or question go unsolved or unanswered."
"I used this company to host a small business. I wanted to cancel the service after about 4 months due to my wife/business partner passing away and the business closing. When I contacted their customer service to close the account I was told I could not receive ANY refund. Ok, that&#039;s not good but fine. fast forward 6 months and I receive emails about auto renewal. So I contact them again to close the account so my credit card doesn&#039;t get charged again. This time the customer service rep says he can&#039;t refund the entire amount but can refund the unused portion. When I ask why I was told 6 months ago there would be no refund but now I&#039;m being told I can get one; his reply was &quot;last agent forgot on this process &quot;. So, because of this lame excuse I&#039;m now out $500. Wish I could tell the IRS I forgot the process that&#039;s why I didn&#039;t pay taxes"
Untrustworthy business and breach of personal information given out including email and phone number while domain privacy is still in effect.  I am not sure how this service is rated top in the field as I was besieged by a number of people trying to contact me to set up my website while my domain privacy was still intact. A total of 14 phone calls and emails over there today. And this was immediately after joining bluehost. No mention of the domain privacy when signing up. The word press set up for the webpages was less than desirable. Stay clear of this business as I am sure they will be out of business sooner than later.
"I have used Bluehost for more than 5 years. They are well optimized if you are running a Wordpress site. That is their specialty. The one complaint I have about them is the customer support. The wait time is long. And once you get them on chat they are chatting with ten other people at the same time so that entire process is very long as well. Call them instead of trying to use chat if you are short on time. They no longer have a ticketing system at all. So, it&#039;s chat or phone only."
"after I paid for everyhting,,$149,,,the email was not working...I made international calls ( cost more than $150!) between them and Godaddy to know the issue and fix it. first mistake, Bluehost charge me the wrong price! they charge me $10 while its $140!!! ( $129 in Godaddy). Second mistake, after the calls,,,the first customer service correspondent, went by himself, and refund me my office 365!!! i told him 2 times to do nothing till i call Godaddy! now i have to pay again to them to get the same service which is their mistakes in both times!! I called again and spoke to another guy,, he want helpful ( Alex) and i went to buy another domain. after more than 4 hours,,and after useless Live Chat,,the lady on the other side, from her answers seems she knows nothing!!! useless!! pathetic! i requested to talk to the manager,,after all of this long Chatting,, he said he WILL TRY to fix the issue!!!! he was doing me a service! a favour!! what a professional customer service!!! you did both mistakes!!! and i had to pay for the international calls!!! and I had to call and chase you to fix my problem. you did nothing but making it worse!!!!ugly and ** service, nothing is well in the first 24 hours!!! what will happened after that?!!?!? what they will do next???!!!!

it is a mistake that i went to deal with you..my bad. you should refund all my money. I will not stop writing here till I got my money"
I&#039;ve experienced nothing but excellent customer service in setting up our account. I researched several companies for my hosting needs and am so pleased I decided to go with Bluehost.
This host is fast and responsive whenever I contact them and their pricing policy is simple and affordable for the webmasters with a tight budget. Their tech staff is helpful for me and they are skillful and knowledgeable.
Was down too often than online
"Never had a problem with Blue Host, except their pricing. When I signed up, it was implied the domain and hosting fees were locked in, but they keep increasing (by a lot). Excellent hosting though - the cPanel has all the features most anyone needs, and the servers are virtually never down."
"After migrating a few of my websites to Bluehost, nothing but problems have arisen. I&#039;m appalled at their lack of intelligence or ability to think. I have to repeat everything 10 or 15 times. It was apparent in the first email that they didn&#039;t know what was going on or how to solve anything.

1. ) On 1 PRO hosting account I&#039;ve had a website that was extremely slow, so after talking to them, they told me to upgrade to a dedicated VPS service and transfer the domain. They said it would be done in a matter of hours however it ended up taking 5 days of my website being offline without any improvement the website speed after the upgrade. When you start reaching out to their support you start realizing what a horrible company they are. The support staff is inexperienced and tell you different stories the whole time only to meet their quotes and making you spend more money but without actually helping you. I&#039;ve lost more than a thousand dollars on this account and they do not reimburse you for it only of more of their $#*!ty hosting.
2. ) On my second account [SCAM ALERT] they took 3 of my websites offline with the reason that I&#039;ve exceeded their usages limits (even though they say its unlimited usage) because of too big of database size and to upgrade to their PRO account:
    1. I was already on a PRO account
    2. After my developers checked everything it turned out I never exceeded the thresholds of 3000 tables or 5GB anyways.

This means they are just running a scam by taking your websites offline and then offering the solution to get them back online by paying more money to them. My websites were down for 6 days and I&#039;ve lost hundreds of dollars in income, have to pay my developers for all the work they did and NONE of it will be refunded by Bluehost. I migrated everything away from them and they do not even want to refund my sign-up costs. It is a total scam run but incapable and money-grabbing people whereas the CEO of Endurance group Jeff Fox made $10.000.000 in 2019 alone and the CEO of Bluehost Suhaib Zaheer $2.300.000. Be aware you do not get scammed by them, I&#039;ve warned you. They are an evil company run by people with zero morals. I am going to report their theft to the FTC, BBB, and law enforcement. I will not go down without a fight and they will regret stealing from me and other affiliates as their reputation sinks in the toilet."
"We have multiple accounts with Bluehost, and our first account dates back to 2006. In earlier times, Bluehost tried hard to get your business and gave us the needed attention and was able to fix problems right on the spot with a simple telephone call. BUT, not anymore!  During the last five years, Bluehost and its affiliates lack tremendous of customer service support. Not able to resolve the simplest issues that would just take a few minutes of their attention to react to the customer needs.
In the meantime, we could write a bestseller: &quot;The Best Way How To Drive Your Customer To Madness&quot; with all the negative and deceiving experiences we made with the Bluehost and its affiliations over the last few years. The latest debacle we have is regarding a corrupted directory.
Bluehost acknowledged in writing that they have valid backup files which should not take more than 10 minutes to reinstall to fix the damaged directory.  BUT, for the entire last two weeks, Bluehost customer service did not start with the restoring works. We called 96 times Bluehost&#039;s customer service, which is notable in the Philippines and not in the USA! The customer service in the Philippines has no access to the customer accounts to service them. It is all phony. They tell you that they send you an email to which you need to replay.
If you once get an email, so after every four to five calls, and you replay to it, you will find that the return address of this email is: support_noreply@bluehost.com. We tracked this email and found that it ends up nowhere, sent to empty space. We requested other email addresses and had some emails going forward and backward (a total of 36 emails) with the Philippine custom service.
Long story short. 2 Weeks, 96 Calls, 36 emails, 6 Tracking-Numbers, and 2 Case-Numbers later and Bluehost could still not be moved forward to start a 10 minutes directory reload from their backup server. In the meantime, we are losing business. When it comes to mailing out your bills, Bluehost is the fastest (and please check those bills carefully), when it comes to service .. just forget about it.
Be warned that Bluehost is operated by Endurance International Group. Also, be aware that this group has multiple different host-providers and internet services such as HostGator, ConstantContact, iPage, SiteBuilder, Bigrock, and we made the same, very disappointing experience, with all those services provided by Endurance International Group. And if you don&#039;t believe it, be my guest and try it out. But don&#039;t come back crying and say that I didn&#039;t tell you so!"
"Bluehost started off as a referred service a few years ago and the first issue started with their security services. But rather than switching, I proceeded to continue doing business with the company(see receipt) and that was a huge mistake. For someone that has their top quality products, the service from ill informed techs to lack of support when malware or a bug shuts off my site is poor at best. I described it to them and everyone else like this: &quot;Imagine you just bought a new car and the dealership won&#039;t let you drive it off the lot without getting some parts fixed on it. Rather than the dealership doing it for free since you spent so much with them, they want to get paid more!&quot; I feel taken advantage of and ripped off, my website/app is suffering because they found one jpeg malware and couldn&#039;t tell me for a couple days on how to remove it and wanted payment, even though their techs could of done it in an hour. I understand this can&#039;t be a constant free service, but as the first issue in years, why not give good customer service? Also speaking with the techs, they sent you back and forth and you can&#039;t even hear them half of the time because their headsets are junk. Their new automated voice service and &quot;token&quot; system is also a joke and doesn&#039;t work properly. Extremely disappointed in Bluehost and I have dealt with GoDaddy and other web hosting providers over the last two decades that have way better service. I guess my mistake for listening to someone without doing my research."
"Believe me when I tell you that I did not expect Bluehost to make it at all. It’s not that I haven’t heard some good things about it, but I got the impression that it just wasn’t what it used to be.
The company got sold, the original founder left, manpower was “optimized,” and support was outsourced. It didn’t sound promising at all. When reviewing other web hosts with similar history, my recommendation was to definitely avoid them.
After trying Bluehost myself, I can say that it really wasn’t that bad. Plans are pretty generous with basic resources, and it’s mostly easy to use. Support is subpar, sure, and the password debacle was extremely disconcerting, but I’ve seen so many worse hosts.
So, should you go with Bluehost? Frankly, I don’t think you should.
Still not sure if this is the right web host for you? Check out our top recommended web hosts to learn more.
Even if your needs are simple, why not go for great? Why not enjoy the full power that quality hosting can give you? Check out WPEngine, Flywheel, or Hostinger before making a decision. They’re super beginner-friendly and simply miles ahead.
How Reliable Is Bluehost? Bluehost is generally quite reliable, meeting the average 99.9% uptime that most hosts promise. However, Bluehost doesn�t have an uptime guarantee as such.
Can I Upgrade My Bluehost Plan at Any Time? Yes. If you want to upgrade (or downgrade) you�ll need to switch off automatic renewal and you�ll then see the upgrade options available to you when you select &#8216;Upgrade�.
Which Is Better – Bluehost or SiteGround? Although Bluehost has improved in speed and reliability, SiteGround offers more features and has an uptime guarantee. Make sure you read our full comparison review of Bluehost vs SiteGround before you make your decision.
Is Bluehost Good for Beginners? Bluehost is relatively easy to get started with, so yes, it�s suitable for beginners.
Do I Own My Own Domain with Bluehost? Yes, you have complete ownership of your domain if you register it through Bluehost when you sign up for hosting.

That's when my horror story started. They owed a refund of $70 which I have yet to receive after a month.
The first BS was they could only credit to the payment method originally used years before. After days of incoherent delays, they claimed they credited my account in numerous emails. Except they didn't.
Finally I contacted their so-called CEO, Suhaib Zaheer, (szaheer at endurance.com or zaheersuhaib at gmail.com.
He abdicated the case to his incompetent staff.
First by a nice young lady was misdirected by the Bluehost Billing Dept as to the issue. She was seeking a bank solution for a PayPal problem.
Nothing happened.
The next day I got a call from Dave who apologized for the mess. He would get a PayPal refund that day. No refund.
Then I received (would you believe) a call from the CEO himself. Mr. Suhaib Zaheer assured me he would solve.
He didn’t.
I told him to go to hell - I didn't want the refund which I have yet to receive going on three weeks.
Avoid Bluehost at all costs. It’s a mess. They chose a new automated support software solution that doesn’t work.
Further Bluehost is both overpriced and incompetent.
The review sites that give them high ratings have not used the service.

"BlueHost is a budget shared host (although their renewal prices don&#039;t suggest that), targeted towards beginners without a decent amount of technical knowledge. Their support department isn&#039;t great. And their performance in key areas like site speed and uptime leave a lot to be desired."
"Bluehost is a hosting provider with strong customer service, uptime, and value for money. If you're looking to host a WordPress site, then this is the provider for you. Some of Bluehost's features are stronger than others, though – read on to learn more."
"Bluehost is one of the older brands in the world of web-hosting, having been in business since 1996. Recently acquired by the Endurance International Group, Bluehost now operates under the same top-notch management team as iPage, giving their existing customers a solid option to go for if they’re uncomfortable with iPage’s control panel (iPage uses vDeck, while Bluehost uses cPanel, which is a lot more popular among users).

Tons of Awesome Hosting Features with Bluehost

Bluehost has a ton of terrific features and many advantages over their peers. For example, unlimited web-hosting – who doesn’t like having unlimited bandwidth, email accounts, FTP servers & MySQL databases? SSH – check. Ruby-on-rails – check. Free domain – well, first year free but still, check. To top it all off, Bluehost also made sure that we get 24/7 US-based support, resulting in efficient communication and quicker ticket resolve times. At this price range, Bluehost easily made it into our top hosts-of-choice.

But it’s not all rainbows and sunshine in wonderland – we found certain disadvantages when using Bluehost that might be a deal breaker for some users. Although reliability is excellent (99.9% uptime guaranteed), Bluehost recently introduced a feature called “ CPU throttling ” to control server traffic. This means when they detect unusual spikes in traffic, they’ll slow down the offending site in order to protect and maintain regular traffic for other users. While this generally is a good thing as it protects users from other’s misconduct, it leaves business-users at a major disadvantage if they get featured in popular sites like Reddit, Digg or Mashable. The sudden influx of traffic will cause Bluehost to throttle or even worse, suspend your site – definitely not an ideal situation for businesses.

Bluehost Is Perfect For Bloggers & Small Business Owner

In conclusion, Bluehost is a pretty awesome host if you’re a beginner, blogger or small business owner. However, big businesses have no business (pardon the pun) putting themselves at risk of site suspension due to overwhelming traffic. If you’re a big business owner, you might want to consider Inmotion Hosting instead. If not, then with a 30-day money back guarantee, you can try out Bluehost yourself and see if they’re well-suited for your needs.

"Shameful, I posted my original review several years ago and nobody from this company bothered to reach me. After so many years using their services I felt at least I deserved a follow-up call but it looks like their management does not feel the same way. Sadly, I'll remember Bluehost as the amazing web hosting provider it was before the company was purchased by a heartless invesment firm."
"My site was down for days because they couldn't figure out how to do math, a billing issue from 6 months ago on their end. The site was back up for about 3 days now down again because of what I am being told is a compliance issue. At one point when my account was suspended and they had no answer for me they actually told me to call register.com, the service I used to register the company though they are the hosting company that suspended my site. These have been ongoing issues and I am unfortunately now going to have to switch providers which is a long and arduous process. I would give them zero stars if I could, absolutely horrible service."
"How they are rank one of the top 10? you can find that disclosure by clicking at the top right of the hosting company which dispays them as the top10 (And the unswer is base in paid compensation.) I learn that the hard way. Bluehost is part of Endurance International Group and if you ever have an resolvable problem with bluehost, they will be no where to be found. Be carefull of those companies the internet and hosting industry is very irregulated and if you do not know what you are doing, they will really take advantage of you. You will have the worse experience of your life by joining Bluehost!!! They been traying to take over my two domains for a long time, and in order to do that they made changes to my accoount without my concent. I was even ask to provide government ID, in an intent from them to intimidate me base on racial profile. You can not even imagen what you will go trough with this company, and do not trust the page which displays the 10 top hosting companies read their diclosures carefully."
"So Bluehost / Hostmonster which are the same company, has ""fair"" or ""bad"" support. They typically have chat service that works, but it doesn't always. Today I was bumped off & had to sit through another wait before being helped. Their answers are sometimes pretty vague. For example, was trying to transfer a domain away from them. You get the help docs on everything up to the point where they have to approve the transfer. It's there that you have no control. There is a ""wait period"" that you don't get with any other provider that I know of. Don't purchase your domains at Hostgator. They're an ""ok"" host for sites, but they have their outages, slow servers, and do not have the free SSL certificates that other hosts are now offering."
"Bought a domain from bluehost for cheap. The website at checkout had another name I was searching...it was a nightmare to try to cancel. It's not really a 30 day cancelation policy they still charge u a ""handling fee""...which is the same price as a domain bc they said I have it for a year...I'm just letting it expire at this point. Poor support team and they said I can't cancel or transfer the name (off by two letters). I ended up buying the domain I wanted from another provider that was more transparent and had an actual 30 day cancelation policy. Wait it gets better...I been getting calls from indian about 2 calls per day for the past month bc I bought the domain about web designing service...I'm not even using the domain and use Wordpress anyway. So basically u have to buy their privacy service or the company sells ur info to make money...that's why they are so cheap...but u get what u pay for. Such a headache. You might as well get a domain from a real service like godaddy, 1and1, or whatever. For a few dollars a year more u don't get poor service and ur information sold out."
"My website had be hosted on Bluehost for several years. Then, without warning, visitors to my site saw a bunch of illogical Chinese characters, or, a page with Account Suspended. Nothing had been done by me to prompt this. Needless to say, Bluehost is no longer my hosting site."
"Don't use bluehost. They are dishonest. They lure you in with cheap hosting but once it's time to renew, they slap you in the face with whopping charges. They make it extremely difficult to transfer domains from third party sites. It takes 60 days to transfer domain, and once you do, they will charge some random transfer fee. They are dishonest and will lose lots of customers with their devious business tactics."
"My experience has been poor with bluehost. I had them install site lock as per their suggestion to protect our website and now it is causing all kinds of issues such as not being able to make the payments, blocking me out of my email and causing problems with the links on my website. Beware of bluehost!"
"Their website is super cumbersome to use. My website does not load the pictures that should be there. Perhaps I am doing things wrong, but they emphasize that it's so easy. It's not. It's extremely non-intuitive and difficult to create a website."
"RUN RUN RUN!! FAR AND FAST!! I moved my 10 year old website to Bluehost bc of great reviews - OUT THERE (I never thought to check Yelp!), and I was put on the highest premium plan that included backup and everything else on Nov 14th. Two weeks later, due to another issue, I found out my 'quota' was full on the 15th and there were NO BACK UPS and NO NOTICE TO ME!! I lost 2 weeks of work plus another week down trying to resolve this problem which, had it not been for my web designer and GoDadday, I would have been out of business for good. When I called BH to see how to get a new pw it took the tech 8 minutes to search for the answer which I ended up finding faster via google!! When I called to get a full refund I was only given a partial refund per the receipt sent me. I called back and after nearly an HOUR on the phone I was told they cannot make TWO refunds in one day!! I have lost 3 weeks of work, as has my assistant. And I lost 2 advertisers which is the only way I earn any $$ at all. The folks on the phone were very polite and I did not loose it when talking to them, it is their job and they do the best they can within the parameters of a very poorly run company. And I don't know why YELP is hiding all these other reviews that are negative. But my advice; STAY FAR AWAY FROM BLUEHOST!!"
"worst exp I ever had! signed up over the phone, never received welcome email and was running out of time to move my hosting services, spent 30 minutes with out of the US service center with marginal english and bad VOIP who refused to transfer back to a US based rep, finally after 4 calls i spent an extra 20 minutes through an interrogation and countless requirements from me, the customer who was caused damages to ""proof"" my account! I gave up! charge back to my credit card and no matter how ""good of a deal"" it is, this experience has costed me money but more than that it costed me sanity and blood pressure! NEVER AGAIN!"
"I just spent two days trying to get a refund and was told I'd receive different amounts by two different people and an email. I was disappointed not to receive the full amount I paid, especially after purchasing this crap only two days prior, but three different amounts? I received another email with a refund amount minus tax. Tax on what? And why did I pay taxes twice - once during purchase and again to cancel??? It was also impossible to transfer my WP domain to Bluehost, but was lured into believing it's the greatest web hosting company on the planet by reputable businesses who should be ashamed of themselves. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that what little refund they allegedly gave me actually arrives."
"I had three websites with Bluehost. I was attacked by a WSO attack. Bluehost shut my sites down, had me purchase a one time clean from SITELOCK (for $195) and after the clean put my sites back up. (FYI, no one advised me to change any passwords.) Within 8 hours the sites were down again. During a 3 hour phone call to tech support the sites completely disappeared. Bluehost tech and supervisor could not explain any of this. I had to get a ticket and wait 48 hours. My web developer figured out the WSO attack and called Bluehost to warn them of this. Nothing...no call or email. Then, 10 days later Bluehost finally gets back to me with an email informing me my sites had been attacked. Really? That's was what my web developer had already told them. I left Bluehost after 10 years."
"Site is continuously down. Certificates are broken. Triple billed for some services. Calling to cancel a SSL certificate took me a half hour over the phone. Automated phone system is impossible to navigate. Customer Support Staff are polite but can't understand simple phrases and concepts. ""Why am I being triple billed for the same SSL Certificate?"" The CSR could not understand what I was asking. Not fit for use for any important business purpose."
"This company is garbage. Stay away, products don't work. Billing is impossible to cancel and customer service is a nightmare. I've been trying to get a service they deny billing for showing up on my account. I wouldn't recommend anyone use them and I am disappointed that they are recommended by many other trusted service providers. Mariyam, the second rep I have been stuck online with seems to enjoy providing terrible customer service. Deepna was at least slightly more polite, prior to disconnecting after claiming she would resolve the issue. There are a few hundred other similar complaints for this company on listed on the BBB. Hopefully other businesses stop their affiliate partnerships with them, but I imagine it's a pretty lucrative since stopping service for a product that doesn't work is so challenging."
"BLUEHOST is by far the worse hosting company I ever had the pleasure of doing business with. Nothing in this company works well. Example: Dashboard login: Stuck on Onboarding loop from hell. They so call ""workaround"" does not work. Also stuck on onboard loop of hell. The main feature of the Dashboard ""My sites"" full of bugs. They ""are aware of it"" and have not been dealing with it for the 30 days that I joined them. The Two step authentication. Broken. Does not work. Chat support. A laughable joke. Do yourself a favor. Don't approach with a 20 feet pool. I am beyond frustrated with their lack of care, and sense of pride. They simple don't seem to give a Rats Ass! Finally, when you ask to see a manager, he won't stop to talk to you. instead he tell you that they will send you an email. Obviously client happiness stands at a very low point in their priority list. DON""T APPROACH WITH A 20 FEET POLE. You will thank me later."
"I've been trying to get a refund from Bluehost for services that I did not use. Bluehost has agreed to refund, but as the account I used to originally pay for the service is no longer in use, they are requesting an insane amount of documentation from my former financial institution to complete the refund. I've provided them documentation that was requested, but now they want a letter from my old bank on official letterhead (which my old institution tells me they will not provide) to complete the refund. This process has taken me hours upon hours of waiting on the phone and visiting a branch location. For what it's worth, I'd advise anyone to avoid Bluehost if they want to do business with an ethical company. They have intentionally made this process as difficult as possible all over $100. Shameful. Go somewhere else for hosting. Anywhere else."
"Worst service ever!!! Save your time and money and do yourself a favor, do not use this company!!!! They have absolutely no respect for their client. They hit you with hidden fees, your website gets hacked continuously, they're just a mess!! and if you try co ya ting them, they simply tell you there's nothing they can do, they try to sell you other products and services without solving the main problem."
I'd give them negative stars. If I could. Calling the bbb on them now. RUN! Don't care if Wordpress recommends them. They are the worst from sign up on
"Have used them on and off for several years and I have zero complaints. Granted, my websites have very little traffic and are pretty simple but over the years every single one I've hosted with them hasn't ever had any major issues, downtime due to maintenance or whatnot on their end has been very minimal and whenever I ef something up they're quick to help me get back online."
"horrible service, horrible email servers, Not capable of hosting real business solutions. save yourself time and aggravations."
My site has been down for 6 days. Ive contacted tech support 8 times. They keep telling me someone is working on it and will get back to me. Bull.

I don't get why they couldn't just send a warning, keep the site live and give me 72 hours to find another hosting so that service isn't interrupted on the spot.

"I tried hosting my e-commerce WordPress website but was facing some issues. Glad that BlueHost's support team did it for me, they were superhelpful. Uptime, bandwidth, speed, all on point. Also, these guys are quite cheap when it comes to the stuff they provide you with.,"
"Bluehost has long been a favorite of mine in the shared and WordPress hosting spaces. The company adheres to modern standards for hardware, and its customer support is fantastic. Bluehost’s shared server options will accommodate the vast majority of customers' hosting needs for a web presence. Once you outgrow the traffic allowances of shared web hosting, however, Bluehost excels in the VPS and dedicated hosting niches, too.

What makes Bluehost packages most appealing is the company's reputation for affordability and usability, which both web novices and veterans can appreciate. Added incentives, such as free domains, marketing credits, and unlimited emails, make this provider a bang-for-the-buck favorite throughout the hosting community. 

For those just getting started, perhaps on their first website, we’d like to point out that Bluehost has revamped its user experience — beefing up the user-friendliness factor significantly in recent years. Users will find the dashboard and overall customer experience to be welcoming — about as non-daunting for newcomers as web hosting gets. If you’re looking for WordPress hosting specifically, whether on a shared, virtual, or dedicated server, you’ve come to the right host. Bluehost is one of the few providers endorsed by the WordPress Core team. Install the popular blogging platform in a single click via the control panel, or have the company's managed services team take care of it for you.

As previously mentioned, Bluehost also tops the charts in server hosting — offering fantastic performance at competitive prices. With two to four cores and guaranteed resources, your virtual or dedicated server will be performant, powerful, and online virtually 24/7. The Bluehost team leverages industry-leading open-source technologies, such as KVM and OpenStack, to eke out as much performance as possible, leaving you with the utmost flexibility and reliability. Sold? VPS and dedicated plans include instant provisioning because waiting for your server is so 2000s. 
FREE domain and SSL certificate

 Money Back Guarantee: 30 days Disk Space: 50 GB - Unlimited Domain Name: FREE (1 year) Industry-Leading Reputation and Support 
	With its long-term work in the hosting industry, Bluehost understands the significance of customer service. You can reach Bluehost support personnel and peruse its extensive knowledgebase 24/7.
	As one of the world's leaders in web hosting, Bluehost has built services on or using cutting-edge open-source technology.
	The company is endorsed by some of the most prominent and successful open-source projects on the planet, including WordPress.org.
 Includes Domains, Email, and Backups 
	Bluehost has a custom domain manager that helps with domain transfers, purchases, tracking, and overall administration.
	Unlimited email accounts come with all shared hosting plans, along with POP3 and IMAP support and spam protection.
	Each account is backed up daily, weekly, and monthly, so you can revert your site to a previous condition should disaster strike. This is highly preferred to restarting your site's development, content, or design from scratch.
 Easy Scaling Across Products 
	As your site picks up steam, traffic grows, and (hopefully) revenue starts flowing in, your web host will ideally be equipped to help you perpetuate that growth. Upgrading from a shared account to a VPS or even a dedicated server is a painless process with Bluehost.
	Built on cPanel, Bluehost has a custom interface that includes additional tools to simplify website and server management. Handle general administration, manage domains, set up email accounts, and access files from one simple-to-use dashboard.
	The host touts one-click installs of popular software programs, including WordPress, Drupal, Magento, and other applications.
 Constant Hardware Updates 
	Price isn't the only factor you should consider when choosing a host. As new hardware, such as solid-state drives, come onto the market, you want assurance that your host has the bandwidth to accommodate these changes.
	Google and other search engines take your site's speed very seriously, and you should, too. The Bluehost team is highly aware of the performance ramifications at stake, and the brand wants its customers' sites to operate at screaming-fast speeds.
You could probably find cheaper options out there, but you're not guaranteed the level of service and performance that Bluehost's reputation ensures.
 Bluehost has a modern, sleek company website, and that clean design extends to the platforms and interfaces customers use behind the scenes. Setting up a domain is simple, as is virtually any objective you tackle with Bluehost — whether you're installing WordPress with a single click or configuring your email hosting. &quot;Basic&quot; Plan: $2.95/month &quot;Plus&quot; Plan: $4.95/month &quot;Choice Plus&quot; Plan: $5.45/month For the level of service and performance that Bluehost offers, the company's price point is amazing. While some services are slightly more expensive than those of some other hosts, Bluehost more than makes up for it in features, reliability, and support. Bluehost has been in this industry since 2003. Having been acquired by the mega hosting conglomerate Endurance International Group, Bluehost is no doubt one of the leaders in the industry today. The company offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee, which is basically the standard in the industry. With more promising uptime rates comes higher price points, so Bluehost presents a bargain that balances cost with reliability. bluehost Includes: 24/7/365 Live Support via Email, Phone, and Chat, and Extensive Knowledge Base To recap, here's a rundown of what Bluehost has to offer: Bluehost embodies performance, reliability, affordability, and user-friendliness — four of many tenets the team members pride themselves on delivering to customers. Having personally been a Bluehost customer, I can vouch for this company's commitment to the hosting community, and it's great to see the continued improvements to flexibility, speed, cost, and so on. This is a host you can trust as a novice, and Bluehost's services are the type with which you can grow your personal brand or professional site — from shared to cloud servers and beyond."

PlatinumHost might offer a good service at a reasonable price, but does it match up with the top web hosting companies? We find it hard to say &#8220;yes.&#8221;

The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact and meet new people on the daily basis even seeing returning an regular faces giving people a sense of welcoming feeling seeing the smiling faces especially the children an elderly.
"Generally I loved working at Buffalo Wild Wings. I was respected as a person, made friends, smiled a lot and met a lot of people. I was given opportunities of advancement, raises and also health benefits."
Working here made me feel apart of a family and rarely felt like a job. It was fun to go to work and be able to basically hangout while getting paid to do some small tasks to help people and the company. They are very helpful in training and make everything very easy for everyone.
"I was always happy to go into work and see my coworkers. Clean work environments, nice tips on top of hourly wage. Also 50% off food on paid lunch break."
"If you like people and a fast paced environment, this is the place for you. And if you can deal with different personalities of customers, this is also the place for you."
"My overall experience at bdubs was chaos to say shortly. Some of my coworkers were amazing but management does not care about their employees what so ever! Most managers spent 75% of the time in the office, smoking outside, or BSing in a big group at the back of the restaurant. The servers are cliquey and rude sometimes but if you mind your own, it’s not too bad. But not to mention there’s a large volume of homeless people that come inside and cause chaos sometimes and the drunk people coming from the bar sometimes puke all over the bathrooms and restaurants."
My first after school job outside of family business. I worked with some really good people. I was a cashier/greeter. I was able to provide great customer service to all customers in the establishment. I was able to learn about other job duties in the restaurant. I met all types of people through this job and it was a pleasure through employees and customers.
"This was a good high school job. There is no room for company growth or promotions. Also, there is a big turn over rate in employees and managers. Not many people stay here. They also don’t appreciate their employees. Only the ones that mess up."
Working at Buffalo Wild Wings has helped me learn patience and care. Not everyone will be satisfied but it has helped me to make sure I can do whatever I can to make sure they are satisfied.
learned how to work fast and give great customer service even on bad personal days. most enjoyable part of the job was create great bonds with coworkers.
Not enough help with the bartenders and servers especially during big rushes. Goes against my availability. Too many servers calling out. Having servers work overtime.
"The store I worked at, Oak Park Height, MN, is no longer in service anymore. But when I did work there it was a really bad environment to be in and the managers knew nothing about controlling a business."
"Overall it was a fun job to work, the only thing difficult about the job was management, the general manager was very very rude to the employees and she played favoritism all of the time. Anytime I call Human Resources and report her , the people in Human Resources would tell her and she treated me even more poorly , after I told them I wanted to stay anonymous ! She threatened to fire me everyd at !"
"As a host it the first thing everyone see as they walk-in is your face. Knowing your way around the restaurant like where the bar is, how the seating is arranged, where the bathroom is, and the take out area. Also what is playing and if we have it in the TVs."
"Good management, Learned a lot of hard working skills, Good workplace culture, every day experience was dinner rush hours and slow mornings, the people made the job most enjoyable."
Working there can cause you to either do nothing during the downtimes to running around frantically during the busy hours. During down times you will be doing mindless tasks while other people sit around. you might be the hardest working person there but you will never get a raise unless you work in the kitchen
Not very supporting and doesn't give much hourly wage and not great on hours or great with their employees. Everybody only cares about themselves. That's not very great.
"Buffalo Wild Wings was my first job, and I am grateful for the experiences it provided. I learned a great deal of patience and how to better handle myself when confronted with conflict."
"Not a bad place to work, you make really good money during holidays if your servings, some management wasn’t the greatest but the others were great. They were very family oriented when I worked there."
"Worked here as a takeout cashier for 2 years, singlehandedly the WORST job I’ve ever had. Managers picked favorites, scheduled you on days you requested off MONTHS in advance, and wrote people up for having to attend funerals instead of go to work. Unfair, take advantage of younger kids working, and offer ZERO room for movement (host to server, server to bartender) whatsoever."
I was there for over a year. It was great being a hostess. But being a server there was stressful. Some customers were not so very nice as well as a one of the managers. But other than that the it was fun..
They were very polite and knowledgeable. I was able to get all the details I needed to make my next decision. Very pleased with the conversation.
She's really quick and reliable. Understands very well what I wanted.
"Amazing support, fast & experienced

thanks to Angela"
"very good experience with angela, they are very professional and also they have goo experience...."
Great information and attendance! Polite and great professional.
"They didn't push the most expensive hosting service at me, they actually helped, a lot."
"FAKE REVIEWER WORKS FOR MONEY

I have an review page with this Review directory and at the starting it works well but after sometime they started publishing only the negative reviews

There are some customers who made positive reviews but these guys are not listing those things.If i contact them about this over livechat they will inform me the do mail to info@ but i will get only 1 auto reply about there system and no response if i reply to that mail

if we ask more questions over livechat they will simply block your chat

if you guys have this review system defiantly you need to pay money to get positive reviews listed or you need to close your business and move on 

Don't use them ! 

TRY TRUSTPILOT THIER SYSTEM IS AUTOMATED AND PERFECT"
Olesya Nicolae was absolutely amazing. She ran through the hosting options quickly and clearly. very impressed with her knowledge and professionalism. Very good outcome. She was immediately there when i started the chat and so good to not have a bot at the other end!!!!!!!
"Excelent customer service and straight answers to my questions, cleared all my doubts in one chat!!  Thanks."
"Where do I start?
It saved me lots of time in researching and verifying hosting plans and companies.
They responded immediately and are easy to talk to. 
5/5 from me."
Angela was great with giving me advice for my startup marketplace.
"Great support.
I got very accurate answers within seconds, I highly recommend it!"
I was just looking at some hosting provider revies and I received an amazing customer service experience via chat. It was really quick and I received incredible information regarding the problem I was facing. 100% recommended.
Olesia Nicolay was amazing! Clear and concise advice for someone who knows nothing about this world!!
"I loved this one

Really glad we bought this - hours of fun ahead!"
"Their raking system is fake, top possitions for companies, they have agreements. 1 - 2 years ago, one top 20 company had just 50 - 60 possitive and negative reviews. Lots of better companies with more reviews was below this company. They had this company in their Hot coupons page.

That's true, they promote top paying companies, money, money. money. 

DO NOT TRUST!"
I just hope that all such reviews are totally damn correct entirely and possibly anyway for whatever possible means out there. Cause for sure such systems could be easily manipulated or something like that absolutely.
"Hi, there 
Thank you so much for your support, it was wounderfull especially Olesya Nicolae the best Hosting Expert.

"Great resource for any website needs! Helped out so much when looking for a new hosting service, with their very in-depth reviews of a wide variety of companies (some I hadn't even heard of before). This was surprisingly good, since so many websites provide reviews that are biased and don't tell the whole situation. Their live chat was very quick, and the representative asked everything I would need and referred me to my now current, amazing hosting provider. Would highly recommend this website!"
"I am a brand new small business owner, and no knowledge on website hosting and requirements.  I was just online chatting with Olesya and she was so very helpful and supportive with my queries.  If ever you are stuck - be sure to use the web chat option!  Very quick and simple and beneficial!"
All my doubts clear.
Very good advice and instant help via chat
Tamara was very much kind and helpfull. Thanks
Such an excellent service.  I did not know that I ended up at this site.  I was looking for a review and this popped up.  The service was quick effeciant and wonderful... Thank for being there
Great service !
"Fake website that uses fake reviews to sell a service to hosting companies which are normally less than average hosting companies. Try to submit a negative review on one of their advertisers, and they ll inform that hosting company to suspend your account if you have an active account with them, and they will refuse to publish your review claiming its fake.
They consider 5 star rating on their advertisers not fake and they will publish it immediately. Fake site that gains money out if lying to the public and in return boosts up ratings for terrible hosting companies and charge them for such unethical Service"
very friendly
"So much helpful, and kindness. want to give her 10 stars!"
Really polite and good providing discounts
This was really helpful choosing a better hosting company..
"The service is really great, not only because of their skills but also but also for their kindness. I really appreciated the service and the advices."
Very helpful and fast service. They saved my time. I recommend!
"Olesya Nicolae was the attendent that gave me the support, I would like to congratulate for her professionalism. She gave me a really great suport and orientation to find a better host for my needs."
"I had angela and she was very succinct in the information she provided, was not pushy and was definitely knowledgeable about the hosting companies she suggested."
Pretty professional Chat and pretty cool ^^ Thanks to all
"I trusted this review site and signed up with Prohoster - one of their highest rated hosting site due to excellent recent reviews like ""click on the support button and support instantly replies with your problems"".  

NOTHING CAN BE FAKER THAN THIS.  Why?  After being charged on my card, I waited for more than a day and still see that my order is still being processed.  So I clicked on the ""support button"".  Guess what?  The page is crashing.  No matter what browser I use - it crashes with an internal script error.  

So, how could someone put a positive review about a functionality that is not working in the first place?  Oh, well, I'm sure Hostadvice will say they probably made some changes to the script.  Well, that is scarier then because it shows they don't have quality control.  Yes, I do know quality control in web development.  I am a Web Development Manager in a large financial institution.  A very important function like the support page is a BIG RED FLAG.  

Also, I posted this negative review in Host Advice pointing to the problem I have.  Guess what - IT IS NOT POSTED.  And I'm sure HOSTADVICE will say later - ""OH IT COULD BE A STRANGE BUG"" like what they replied at other negative reviewers here.  Really?  So your system has a bug when someone posts a negative review?  How convenient isn't it?

HOST ADVICE will give you advice on hosting that will provide them the maximum $ in referrals.  There is really nothing wrong with this - EXCEPT some of these hosting sites which are on the top of their list are scams."
There are wonderful and their Customer Service is top notch.
HostAdvice is just amazing ... I was very confused about which hosting company & plan is suitable for my website but Angela Ross ( HostAdvice Team Member ) saved a lot of Time & guided me very well that now I have no confusion in my mind & i used a coupon provided by her got unexpected Discount as well....

It was great.
Excellent it is always helpful when someone knows exactly what they are talking about. Not only that but she spent I know what must be for her valuable time with giving me information that I as a newbie didnt know. She is a good coach and advisor. I did not expect the level of advice and direction and swore she worked for one of the companies I was comparing or the one suggested. But after looking at the three she was right on target. Thanks again for having her available to help me.
Great support and help with all my website hosting questions. It was a real pleasure.
"Angela was great, she basically changed my life. I was a little annoyed that I had to even look at the website but she calmed me down and I'm using her code she sent. Basically, she deserves a hefty raise or at least extra long breaks whenever she wants."

"FAKE REVIEWER WORKS FOR MONEY

I have an review page with this Review directory and at the starting it works well but after sometime they started publishing only the negative reviews

There are some customers who made positive reviews but these guys are not listing those things.If i contact them about this over livechat they will inform me the do mail to info@ but i will get only 1 auto reply about there system and no response if i reply to that mail

if we ask more questions over livechat they will simply block your chat

if you guys have this review system defiantly you need to pay money to get positive reviews listed or you need to close your business and move on 

Don't use them !

That's true, they promote top paying companies, money, money. money. 

DO NOT TRUST!"
I just hope that all such reviews are totally damn correct entirely and possibly anyway for whatever possible means out there. Cause for sure such systems could be easily manipulated or something like that absolutely.

I contacted them to receive a copy of my file and was told to wait for an admin. Never heard from an admin so I contacted again. I kept contacting them every couple days to express urgency on the issue because I knew they would eventually delete all my content. I kept being reassured that an admin would surely send my files. After 4 weeks, I finally received my file. They told me to download some app to extract the files. Not being tech savvy, I wasn't able to do it. I hired someone to extract the files and they were also unable to do it. Turns out, my file was empty. They had deleted my content the day after I cancelled and instead of just telling me, I had to wait four weeks for nothing.
Secondly, I was told my refund would be processed within 2 weeks. After 3 weeks and every week after, I contacted them and was reassured my refund would be processed as soon as possible. It's been 8 weeks and now they are saying they are unable to find the ticket number for my refund in their system.
After this experience, I would never use hostgator again. Sure everything is fine and the technicians are fairly helpful until you actually have an issue. Then they are just incompetent and will screw you over.

Then one day you decide to migrate, find a new host, discover how fast your website loads at the new provider.
Then you come to review boards like this-one to release your frustrations.
Hostgator is an old sinking ship. just look around and see all the new innovative companies. the problem is you seek and find these reviews after the fact, people should read these comments before they purchase their hosting account.
Since its not really that much money, and some of these companies offer a few days money back, what i did was sign up to 3 of them, to test them out.
FastComet did the trick for me, i then upgraded to dedicated server, and all working perfectly.
Why?
1) the ticket system, intuitive, fast, it just works.
2) the instant chat support, no waiting or filling in all sorts of details, just straight forward to the support team in a flash.
3) these are smart individuals, i am not chatting with someone that has a canned script or someone with limited information. Jack Mason setup my server in minutes; Ivan Penishev migrated my sites and they loaded with-ought even a hick-up, all perfect, a lady by the name of Valeria guided me to select the right plan, they are all synchronized, it all just works.
I did not even look at prices because i do not worry about this, so no feedback... for me the price of a dedicated server or one of these accounts per month cost less than going out to burger king with my family. so why not pay the best for this such important service that is vital to my online business.

chat rep was polite but didn't quite understand what I was saying. They escalated the issue and the ""linux admin"" that replied by email clearly didn't read my concerns.

They replied with some unreleased image optimization links. I'm pretty sure it was a bot responder, not a real person. I have transferred things over to another host, and the difference is immediately noticeable. On the new host things are lightning fast and the staff was super helpful in helping me migrate my domain and website.

reviews to burry the real ones. My word of advice, look for an alternative solution to hostgator.
I took the free SSL service they offered me when i signed up, then my website got hacked. Because all of my other sites and subdomains were under the same folder, they all too got hacked. (they put everything under one folder for some reason) I had previously contacted them about this being a vulnerability and how can we fix this, they would always just try to upsell to a different plan that didnt fit my needs.
After I got hacked, they offered their partner service ""SITELOCK"" its about $70/month/12 months per site, you can do the math if you have multiple sites. I got a 3rd party service to remove the malware but I was told by the 3rd party company that timestamps were different from the previous day and now my account had virus again. Everytime i contacted hostgator they made me wait long periods of time, then after waitting they would tell me they could not help me, it violated terms of agreement. To purchase sitelock. I contacted them to confirm if my account was still infected or not. They would always tell me, to purchase sitelock they would be able to tell me.
I contacted sitelock, they said they couldn't tell me, only hostgator would be able to do that. I literally had to purchase their service for everysite, wether it had virus or not as they couldn't verify anything for me, and thats pretty much what I had to do.
I paid them more, way more than I needed to have my server cleaned, then cancel the service with hostgator a year before end of term and got no refund and had to migrate my servies to another provider.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT PUT YOURSELF IN A VULNERABLE POSITION AND BUY HOSTGATORS SERVICES.

as too costly. I cleaned it with a third party service at cheaper rate.
After one week, all my hosting databases were vanished. No one else has cpanel access but only me and my trustworthy staff.
They said there is no backup available (that's really funny that hosting does not have backup). They said we do not have backup. It is customer duty to keep the backup. After a fight with them, they found a backup and restored but they charged much for that.
Anyway my data was back with some loss. That was ok for me.
Real pain started when after 3 weeks my all files from all websites were vanished in a sudden. I checked public.html and there was nothing. My clients were calling me and hostgator told me the same story that there is nothing. After 3 days discussion with them, i found they have nothing. I found they add malware to the sites so their partner sitlock can have business and i found that they have very week security and files can be vanished.
Now I am helpless and have nothing. I have paid them for whole year. They came back to me and told if I have any local backup, they can restore and will charge for this. If i need root analysis why data is gone, they will do but it will cost me too.
So all the time, they need money and they have nothing for customers. They claim that their backup inod is unlimited but in chat they say, it is overloaded so auto stopped.
They are a curse and nightmare. Do not even even try that hosting otherwise you will lost everything in a sudden like me.

2 Hostgator accounts now. One has many small domains on it. We have never had any problems until recently. Several months ago, I began getting emails to the smaller account only telling me that our web sites were compromised and we should buy Sitelock because if something happens to our sites, they will shut them down. I ignored them. But I did get a different security monitoring program to scan the site daily. Sitelock got to a point where we got several emails a day, and then phone calls. We asked it to stop, it didn't. I sent a complaint to Hostgator customer support and went back and forth with them. 24 hours later, all the sites were infected with Malware. They've blocked access to the sites so I cannot remove it. But I CAN pay Sitelock to remove it. Nevermind. We'll just lose 12 different web sites and start fresh elsewhere rather than give a penny to Sitelock.

ssues that happened when installing Wordpress plugin - and request for FTP settings. I believe simple tasks for a tech support guy.
Their chat applet loads for 10 minutes and above. Most of their support are unfriendly, unhelpful, uninterested to do any job. It's like - don't ask them anything - they are fine like that.
On the support chat there's a specific point for the client : Wordpress - I understand that their support can help with some basic things related to Wordpress. When I announced the errors their support told me: ""I don't see such error- you will have to use another plugin or to speak with Wordpress"" My second question was : I would like to get my FTP settings so I can use FileZilla. The support told me : why do you want to use FTP client you have Wordpress - it's active ! - I responded : because I want to have control over my files and manipulate them. The response was : do it on ""cp"". It was on my 3rd day with them. Where is the CP ?!?
All the support people have a very strange delay between the lines. I ask question and they respond after 4-5 minutes. Imagine a talk with questions of tech matter that require more clarification. You will loose 2-3 hours. The only fast thing the support does is to shoot their last line : if that was everything - ... bla bla have a nice day - they act like they are dropping something very hot.
I believe I am not obliged to know, and learn what and where is located on their site. If I should educate myself with their site map, locations, tutorials - I would be the support myself ! Basically I didn't get answers on my questions and I left the chat confused.
Later that day I threatened that I want to get my money back - and that guy William was probably the only person who started to work WITH me , listening to what I say and giving me links - introducing me with their system, pages - giving me all the needed settings.
I was happy. Really happy and the domain transfer was eventually initiated. William wrote a ticket to their admin and the night was over.
The next morning I woke up and though that if I should have any eventual problems - I cannot play a Russian Roulette with hopes that today on Shift will be that William guy. I don't need to loose my nerves - while at the same time I could do something useful.
I stayed with them only for 4 days and requested a charge back. I didn't stayed with them to see how their system works and how reliable the servers are. Their support is NOT. They don't care. Or the management is picking non professionals just to fill the empty spots.
Just to say : I went with FastComet. The difference is like from Earth to Mars.
I believe even 1 star is too much for their support - but the system won't let me submit this comment without it.
If you are tech guy HG would be probably good for you - for you don't have to use the services of inadequate and lazy support and personnel who are doing everything in slow motion.
If you need assistance like I do - their support won't be happy to see you!

Further i immediately transferred my 4 sites to other hosting and contact HostGator chat support again to remove server restrictions because now their server was handling just 1 website. But they didn't provide any solution for 4 days.

Otherwise you will find out one year later, that their system kept your information and settled the payment method as an automatic and you will be charged for whatever package you were looking for. even though you thought you deleted your information there.
Most importantly, they do not refund? Because they want so. Because they are desperate, hunting for every penny they can steal!"
"HostGator is one of our favorite WP hosting companies. Having used them for over five years, we remain a very happy customer. The servers are fast and well managed and customer support is always there for any questions.
cPanel which is the control panel they use is set up just right for WordPress. HostGator provides several 1-click installers to make it easier than ever to get your next blog up and running.
Server Speed & Uptime
You can expect very good server speed and uptime when using a HostGator Shared plan. The results will only get better when using one of the more robust/expensive plans. Keep in mind that it is shared hosting and one bad site can bring the whole server down. HostGator has nice security measure and monitors to keep this form happening.
Should you decide to go with a 3rd party CDN, just ask support and they can enable rsync which will give you the ability to automatically transfer images and files to the CDN.
Final Thought
It seems that over the years HostGator has been able to refine the art of hosting and especially shared hosting. We are very happy with HostGator and will continue to use them.
As an award winning hosting service provider, HostGator provides top-notch security, management and customer support to its customers through various options."
A problem-free experience for us up until now.
No hesitation in recommending Hostgator and have done so on a number of occassions already.
I would recommend Host Gator for hosting needs
would never use these again after that type of service from them

Thanks for the tip Erin. I shall leave another truthful review there. I encourage other customers who have rated you truthfully that you're a shocking diabolical company on the other review sites.

"I've used hostgator for 10 years.  They used to be much better than they are now.  I wish they could go back.  Don't buy cheap reseller hosting from them.   You will have trouble galore.   We didn't do too bad when we had a VPS with them, but their support in the last 4 years or so has become unbearable to work with.  The bureaucracy is huge.  You can't talk to anyone knowledgeable anymore.  It's all tech-support workers reading from scripts and tutorials.  
I planned on leaving them 2 years ago, but I have so many sites on their server that it would be a huge time commitment to move them all.  I hope I can find the time to do it.  I really don't like them."
"The worst hosting I have ever used, they almost ruined my business!

In early 2019 I subscribed to shared hosting, the ""Business Plan"", for 3 years. Everything looked well while I was migrating my site from my older hosting provider to Hostgator but when my site started to grow significantly and more and more users visited it, came issues (site files are approx 40 GB).

First, my site was down almost every day (and sometimes more than once a day) due to CPU usage limitations, which were well hidden in the plan's description. So, when there are 2 or more users on my site, clicking here and there, and at the same time I edit something in the backend panel, the hosting shows me that I use more than the 25% of the CPU allowed for shared hosting and blocks my site's access to the database until I ""fix the issues"" (as support told me). So what, I should tell users to visit the site 1 by 1, like it has Coronavirus and they should be careful?

This issue led to another - support told me that I can use caching to make my site lighter. And this is what I did - I have a WordPress site and it was easy to find a working solution - I've installed the #1 caching plugin. But in a few days, the site went down again...

I go through the scary process of not having access to my database, once I retain it again, I wasn't able to make a database export because of my database's user having limited access to the database...

After tons of messages with the awful chat support, emails between me and the so-called ""Admins"" and the rest of the Hostgator staff, after many sleepless nights and a lot of time lost, I managed to find a way to migrate my self as they refused to cooperate with the access to the database - they continue to tell me - ""we have access, you should have access too"" but I didn't.

After a lot of time lost, nerves and for sure lost clients due to the quality of the site (when working, it was really slow and I had to work really patiently with it in order to prevent potential CPU issues again), I found a way to access my database via a WordPress plugin, to export it and to move my site to another hosting.

I'm a freelancer for more than 7 years, I've built hundreds of websites, used tens of hosting providers with very different plans, I've even been using VPS servers set by my self, and so on, but my Hostgator experience is the words I ever had, not only with the hosting plan but with the support and the after-sales service too.

STAY AWAY no matter if your site is business or personal - their service is the words I've ever seen. Even now, when I'm writing this review, I'm still angry at them but want to share with people what to expect and sandy I see that I'm not the only one who had a bad experience."
"Update:

It’s odd that Hostgator could not find my account, because there was no trouble billing my credit card today to get the $35.00 they suspended my account for... I’m fact, I even put in the invoice number to this review, but so you know what the account is, it floridaweddingprofessional.com.

It's bad enough that my business is suffering majorly due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and there are no sales and we are basically drowning, one would think. But, no! Hostgator decided to suspend my site over a $35.00 bill I was unable to pay. Certainly, the bill was due, but the fact they offered no forgiveness or time extincion shows their horrible practices from a customer service aspect. I'll be leaving and moving to Godaddy after this is all over!"
"I had hostgator, worst experience ever. They infected all of wordpress sites with a porn virus, trying to force me to buy their sister companies virus protection. Shutting me out of my hosting until I bought their virus protection. Sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory but I finally found the IP that was dropping the virus files in, came from the host gators parent company. I have all the proof. Wish I had the money to sue them. Cost me clients and stress beyond words trying to resolve without buying their virus protection. I honestly don't know how they get away with it. Stay away from any company under the company ""Endurance International Group""."
Most stupid company in the world... Their hosting gets hacked everytime and they suspend it. Also suspend domain without any notification... Just totally worst company. Stay away with it
Good service
Yeah sure they have a 24/7 chatbox but they don't help you with anything. I had GoDaddy and they did things for their clients Hostgator you have an issue get ready to get a bunch of links from the chatbox and do it yourself. It was ridiculous never will return I miss GoDaddy now. 8 days in trying to get my purchased domain site up.
Ha a few unhappy situations with Hostgator but when I contact their support they very quick in resolving quickly!
"Used to be good. I moved my sites from godaddy to Hostgator. Then mysteriously without me making any changes to the sites, the entire node got malware and they push their malware protection services which is a sister company or your sites are locked. 
Many people complaining about the same thing. Google before you make this mistake. Moving all of my business elsewhere. Not GoDaddy, not Hostgator."
"I have a serious complaint for Hostgator. I have a baby plan ( 3 year+ 50 domain package) and multiple domains on the membership for over 6 years, however, why is that once Hostgator charges a new customer for regisitering a domain for Maximum of 12.99 $ why they charge me 18.99$?! Isn't that you must first care and satisfy the current customers?! 

unless Hostgator reduces my domain extentions to the same rate of $12.99 or lower since 2020, I will move and accommodate in more reasonable host company and and will encourage my friends and new business do the same! 
Best, 
Maxim Joseph
A many years unhappy customer"
I had 2 years left and cancelled the billing on the hosting because I didn't want to get rebilled. Cancelled to them means half deleted because I cancelled the rebilling even though I already paid like 400+$ in full. Semantics+ 2020. This is business for some reason and legal. You already paid us so now we'll stop your service because we're lame. I wouldn't advise getting hosting with them. Go with dreamhost or siteground. They suck at everything and their UI is terrible cpanel. I'd much rather host my website at home.
"There was an overload issue with my website database.

Hostgator immidiately  restricted access to my websites till I fix the issue.

I've fixed the issue during one day, and asked them to remove restrictions.

Nothing happened. I've contacted them via email, chat, phone calls during 4 days. Every time I've got reply from support manager that they updated admins, and admins will remove restriction soon.

But restriction is still not removed. The chanses that my websites will lose search engine rankings are increasing. Visitors of my websites are very unhappy. But it looks like Hostgator admins don't care at all

Update: seeral hours after this post appeared on Trustpilot, I was contacted by HostGator manager, and my problem was solved immidiately."

"Overpriced hosting. I cancelled my hosting package but because it was outside of the 45 days from creating I will not get a refund, so essentially I am being forced to pay for something I don't want and that more importantly I WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR. This should be illegal."
"I think it's good to have a live chat open 24/7. However, quite often I find that operators are just rushing to close the chat and get their feedback, with the usual “wait for 24-48 hours for the server to update”. Of course, whether the issue is fixed or not, they will have their positive feedback, because that is written right after the chat is done.
In my specific case, I have been trying to connect my website with Mailchimp for 3 weeks and I still haven’t succeeded, although I was “helped” by Hostgator operators. The last attempt has led to my website to crash. After contacting the customer service, I was told that the website was going to be restored to my last backup and that the server needed 24-48 hours to update. However, after 5 days, and my website was still down. Of course, during these 5 days I have contacted the customer service multiple times and every time I was told that the problem was fixed and to “wait for 24-48 hours for the server to update”.
Now it looks that finally my website is up and running, but still hasn’t got Mailchimp connected."

"HostGator is one of our top-ranked hosting providers for good reason. Its uptime, customer support, and shared plan features are (literally) second to none! Read on to find out if HostGator is the best provider for your site."
"HostGator has lots of great aspects. The plans are feature-packed, catering to experts and beginners, although marginally more geared towards the latter. The prices are affordable (although you need to sign up for a long term to get the best prices)
That said, the support is slow and the upsells are opportunistic.
Overall, if you want an easy-to-use host with decent resource quotas, HostGator is a good bet, with the caveat of limited customer service.

"New web hosting providers and plans pop up all the time, and the most established companies tend to lose some of that personal touch the bigger they become. If you had asked us a while back for our opinion concerning this web host, it wouldn't have been good. However, after reviewing their latest cloud hosting plans, our HostGator WordPress hosting review suggests that they've managed to turn things around.

In this piece, we'll discuss what sets this particular hosting product apart from the rest of HostGator's plans, and how it performs when rated across a variety of criteria. Let's get this HostGator review for WordPress started.
The difference between regular and cloud hosting plans on HostGator
Before we jump into the meat of our HostGator WordPress hosting review, it's important that we make it clear this review will focus on the WordPress-specific cloud hosting plans. If you subscribe to a different type of plan, your mileage may vary.

It's also worth noting that overall HostGator didn't come out looking very good during our recent WordPress hosting survey:

 	It got a 3.7 / 5 overall rating, placing it third from last among nine hosts.
 	Only 74% of the surveyed users expressed an interest in renewing their subscriptions.
 	They scored a 2.4 / 5 for WordPress optimization, and their support was rated 3 / 5 concerning knowledge of the CMS.

Let's see how they do when we limit our evaluation to their WordPress cloud hosting.
HostGator WordPress hosting review - specific features
Considering that this is managed WordPress hosting, we expect a lot of WordPress-specific features to be included. Here's what we found:

 	Free WordPress migration service with the purchase of any plan.
 	Access to several WordPress themes from the MOJO marketplace.
 	Auto-backup and single-click site restore options.
 	Free shared Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.

While HostGator does offer a few freebies to sweeten the deal for prospective customers, their WordPress-specific features are a bit on the light side. However, it's worth noting that HostGator is one of the cheapest managed WordPress hosts around, which explains the lack of advanced features.
Support options
The second stop in our HostGator WordPress hosting review concerns support features. HostGator enables you to contact their staff of specialists via live chat, phone, direct mail, and even fax (we'd love to know if anyone has ever taken them up on that option).

Their support staff is available 24/7, which we can attest to since we contacted them pretty late on both a Thursday and a Saturday. The first time we waited for approximately six minutes and the second time around the wait time went up to ten minutes. Both times, we found their support staff to be a bit tentative with their answers when it came to WordPress, but they did point us towards the right resources to solve our imaginary questions.


Performance
HostGator's WordPress cloud hosting claims to offer up to 2.5x faster speeds than the competition thanks to low-density servers and custom Content Delivery Networks (CDN) solutions. Furthermore, they also enable their users to scale their cloud settings with a single click to deal with unexpected traffic spikes.

Despite being one of the largest providers of web hosting, HostGator only has data centers in two locations:

 	Houston, TX.
 	Provo, UT.

We're not about to blindly trust a web host's speed claims without testing things out for ourselves. So, let's do that.
Pingdom page speed test results
We used a fresh WordPress installation with no frills for this test and ran it with three different Pingdom servers. Here's what we found:

 	Melbourne: 1.72 seconds.
 	New York: 0.75 seconds.
 	Stockholm: 1.39 seconds.

The test results indicate that a wide variation in load time exists based on the geographic location from where the site is accessed – something that could be attributed to the location of HostGator's datacenters. Let's see if that hypothesis stands up to a tougher test.
Basic load testing with Load Impact
Load Impact tests websites by simulating up to 25 or even 50 simultaneous connections over a period of five minutes – this enables us to check how a site does under pressure. For this test, we used the same basic site that we had set up for the Pingdom test. Here's what we found:

 	Load generator: Ashburn, US.
 	Test server: Ashburn, US.
 	Minimum response time: 0.46 seconds.
 	Maximum response time: 0.71 seconds.



These are some of the best load times we've seen from any web host – and they were obtained during a stress test (albeit a modest one). So, our hypothesis holds up. The variations in load time are due to geography and not inconsistent server performance.
Pricing
As we mentioned earlier, HostGator is one of the cheapest options for managed WordPress hosting. There are the three plans on the roster:

 	Starter ($7.96 per month): This basic plan can be used to host a single website with up to 25,000 visits per month. It is perfect for blogs and small service websites.
 	Standard ($9.56 per month): The standard plan will host one or two websites and supports up to 200,000 combined visits per month. It should be more than enough to handle modest service sites and small e-commerce platforms.
 	Business ($14.36 per month): As its name implies, this plan is suitable for established business sites and big e-commerce sites. It can be used to host as many as three websites and can handle up to 500,000 visitors per month.

Earlier, we touched upon the fact that HostGator is a bit light on WordPress-specific features. That remains true, but this provider also offers excellent value, which we believe offsets that shortcoming. Finally, keep in mind that while these prices were correct at the time of writing, HostGator may have modified them since.
Overall pros and cons
We've covered a lot of information so far, so let's take a few minutes to break down a few key takeaways.
Pros

 	HostGator's support staff is available around the clock and provides reasonable service despite not being exceptionally seasoned when it comes to WordPress.
 	They offer temporary scaling options, which are perfect for dealing with occasional traffic spikes without upgrading to a more expensive plan.
 	They will help you migrate your WordPress site.
 	Each plan comes with access to a global CDN and a free SSL certificate.
 	It's fast.

Cons

 	Their managed-WordPress hosting plans are a bit light on advanced WordPress-specific features.

Overall, we feel that HostGator has made impressive strides in improving their WordPress hosting services and we're excited to see if this trend continues over time.
Conclusion
Choosing the right web host is crucial for any site. While this particular web host has been associated with mediocre service in the past, our HostGator WordPress hosting review reveals a sharp turnaround. However, if you're still wary about signing up with HostGator, then take a look at some of our other hosting reviews to see if you can find a better fit:

HostGator has been rated as a mid range web hosting service
"HostGator has been around for more than a decade and is well-respected for its large number of servers and consistent reliability. Known mostly as a shared hosting provider, HostGator still supplies decent dedicated and VPS options if you need your site to scale. 

HostGator costs slightly more than some of the other budget-minded shared hosts, but that echoes the brand's reputation for strong infrastructure and helpful support. HostGator offers decent features in its basic shared hosting offerings, such as unlimited disk space, a nice control panel, and free website templates. Plus, you get the flexibility to add numerous add-ons for privacy, security, and productivity as you see fit.

Aimed primarily at the semi-technical user, HostGator's flexibility is its strong suit. Dedicated, VPS, and Windows hosting is available if that fits your needs, as well. Root access, SSH, and support for Ruby, Perl, Python, and other languages is available on all plans.

HostGator has nearly limitless options and control available for their servers, with the support and beginner-friendly tools that will appeal to the full range of customers. 
 	Familiar and easy-to-use cPanel control panel
 	FREE drag-and-drop custom website builder
 	Unlimited disk space, email, and bandwidth on all plans
 	No contract required and 45-day money-back guarantee
 	62% off your first three years
 	Get started on HostGator now.
 Money Back Guarantee: 45 days Disk Space: Unlimited Domain Name: New or Transfer A Wide Array of Hosting Options 
 	HostGator offers shared, dedicated, cloud, and VPS hosting, as well as domain registrations, a website builder, and reselling options.
 	The crux of HostGator's services is its shared server hosting; this is what the company is known for and excels at. While focusing on the shared server segment of the market, HostGator has mastered what it takes to create a great customer experience, knowing the needs of the shared server client very well.
 	HostGator's understanding of the shared hosting user makes the team the ideal guide to lead customers into the virtual and dedicated server world as they outgrow the shared space over time.
 Lots of Freebies 
 	There are a lot of freebies that HostGator throws in with each hosting plan, including: unlimited disk and bandwidth, a free website builder and website building tools, several hundred website templates, free domain transfers, and unlimited MySQL databases.
 	Additionally, new site owners can call attention to their web property utilizing the $100 worth of Google AdWords credits, courtesy of the HostGator team.
 	Enjoy access to hundreds of one-click installs available for all of the major open-source projects, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Magento.
 Great Support and Guarantees 
 	A 45-day money-back guarantee allows you ample time to try out HostGator and make sure the company's hosting can serve your needs.
 	A 99.9% uptime guarantee is pretty standard for the web hosting industry and will cover most people's needs. If you need a higher uptime rate, you can find it, but it will cost you.
 	24/7/365 support is available via phone, chat, ticket system, and an online knowledgebase.
 Control Panels Galore 
 	HostGator uses the latest cPanel software to power customers' administration consoles. You can get rolling quickly, including tasks like organizing and launching eCommerce shopping carts.
 	Using HostGator's backend account management panel, you can gather stats and logs using AWStats, Webalizer, Raw Log Manager, and Error Logs.
 	Windows hosting customers can oversee their environments using Plesk for website management, email account creation, and software installations.
 From a modern drag-and-drop website builder to the familiar cPanel interface, HostGator excels in providing a simple, yet powerful, user experience.  The setup process is easy to get going with HostGator, given the company's quick provisioning system and clear icons. We found the experience to be straightforward, and when we had questions, we could easily start a live chat to get them answered quickly. &quot;Hatchling&quot; Plan: $2.64/month &quot;Baby&quot; Plan: $3.78/month &quot;Business&quot; Plan: $5.68/month HostGator's pricing is in the middle of the road when it comes to shared and VPS hosting. Good customer service and live chats cost money, and most good beginner web hosts fall in this range. With a 99.9% uptime guarantee, HostGator performs admirably when it comes to reliability. This level of service is the industry standard and while there are hosts with a higher uptime rate, they also have a much higher cost. HostGator has been in the industry for a long time, so you can feel safely assured that they are not a scam and will be around for the long term. hostgator Includes: Extensive Online Knowledge Base for Common Hosting Issues and 24/7/365 Live Support via Email, Phone, and Chat To recap, here's a rundown of what HostGator has to offer: HostGator is targeted toward beginners or those that are looking to host simple websites. The company offers nice VPS and dedicated options to folks whose websites grow outgrow shared servers. Plus, HostGator's been around for more than a decade and they have solid customer support available."

DO NOT use their e-mail service as their servers are on spam/block list and all e-mails you sent will end up nowhere. There is literally no customer service from namecheap to solve this problem. Their service sucks.
I have used namecheap in my 3 website for more than 4 years and got the best service from them in every possible side with best pricing plan. I strongly recommend this for all for any purpposes.

of around $7 for the domain. I got an error saying I can't renew the domain (why even let me pay for it in the first place?).
I went straight to the Live Chat, asking them whats going on. Now I had the hosting plan, but no domain, which were actually coupled to each other. In the Live Chat they asked me to pay $210 redemption fee for the domain. I was not willing to do it. Therefore I wanted to cancel the hosting. At this point it starts to get ridiculous. I had to request a cancellation, but they wouldn't give me any refund. I explained the whole situation, that they just refunded me domain and now I only got this hosting, which is basically useless without the domain. They didn't want to refund me, but they wanted to continue canceling the domain.
Here is what they say:
""Let's clarify some points:
1. Hosting renewals are non-refundable per our policy.
2. If you decide to cancel your hosting package, you will not get a refund for it.
If we receive no reply within the next 24 hours, we will be forced to process your hosting cancelation request.""
This is the stupidest thing I was reading in a while. Literally five minutes after I realized the hosting I just paid $80 for is useless without the domain, which they automatically refunded me after purchasing, I contacted them and asked them to refund the hosting as well. They didn't.
This is just some really bad business and in my opinion its a scam. It was a failure in their system. If I couldn't renew the domain in the first place, I wouldn't have renew the hosting plan.
I will contact my credit card company and PayPal to chargeback the money. You should be aware!

The only problem I have with Namecheap is their servers are located in the USA while my visitors are from the Middle East, so when testing my site on Gmetrix I get 1.4 seconds loading time in the Dallas, USA and 3 seconds in London, I suspect it's even worse where my actual visitors are located,
Also the promo Commodo SSL certificate installed is from the UK, which makes the TTFB 650ms when tested on Bytecheck, consuming 400ms in SSL negotiation alone, I think they can partner with a SSL certificate issuer located close to their servers to improve this unnecessary delay.

Ivan Belous:
Thank you for your patience. You will receive the reply from Risk Management team as soon as possible.
I very disappointed to NAMECHEAP, will not recommend to anyone, and if anyone is using namecheap, I will recomend you all to please transfer your domain to any other good company.

"Appalling service and not a good attitude from chat assistant either. They automatically turn on auto renewal. In my case I contacted them within 24 hours of them taking money for a domain that was to rollover about 28 days later.... Read More
I did not want to keep the domain and asked for a refund. They advised they would not refund because auto renewal was on. Now if it was after the domain registration date I would understand, but a month before? Unacceptable. This would not happen in the UK.

"I recently bought an SSL certificate from namecheap.com and I tried setting it up on my vps. For some reason it didnt work so I ended up contacting online customer support chat. Talked to 1 of them he didnt know what he was doing so passed me on to another guy. I talked to him he walked me through all the steps and tried making out that I am a fool and don't know what I am doing. After being a web designer for over 16 years and managing my own and clients servers for a living Im pretty sure I know how to install a simple ssl certificate... anyway I followed everything he said after 30 minutes of him guiding me through it 2 times he passes me on to his colleague. The colleague guides me through all the steps again and then suddenly cuts me of the chat and it says something like this person has ended the chat. Im like wtf. So I just wasted an hour chatting to them for nothing all the messages are gone that some other staff member could have followed up on and helped me out. Contacted another guy again he basically made out that I wasn't the admin of my own vps so hes basically calling me a liar and that I dont even know if im an admin on my own server what?? Anyway I end the chat and contact them again hoping to get someone decent on the line. The next guy I just say Hi to him and hes like I am aware of your case. The problem is your not an admin on the server what??? I hadnt even said anything to this guy yet and hes talking to me about what the other guy said. So theres basically no such thing as confidentiality everyone internally just talks about you. Anyway after all this I said I just want a refund. They wouldnt even give me a refund through customer services chat. They said open a support ticket requesting a refund. I open a support ticket requesting a refund and they say ill get the refund credited to my account as credits. What? did I ask for credits? I want my money back. I want to leave just the way I came. Anyway after further arguing in support tickets they said I will get a refund. It takes 5-7 working days for their finance department to process my refund. What? More like their going to use my money in a high interest account for a week. I made a complaint and asked for it to be forwarded to the manager. The manager of the ssl department replied and apologized. Whats the point though? I was still charged over £2 pounds in international transaction charges. transaction charges for taking the money from my bank account and then putting the money back added more charges. So in the end I didnt even get a full refund. I recently stupidly again decided to trust them and decided to buy a .uk domain. I thought its a domain right whats the worst that could happen it wont be available and it wont let me register it. Well turns out the truth is even worse. I basically searched for the .uk domain, Added it to my cart because it was available. logged into my account to check out. It took the money from my account im thinking great its bought and then I see a red error message. You cannot buy this domain because the whois details for a .co.uk domain dont match with the .uk domain im trying to buy. So it turns out you have to own a .co.uk domain to be able to buy the .uk domain. Well why didnt it tell me that first? Why did it say its available and then charge me and everything and now all of a sudden its not available? So again they took my money for a service they are failing to provide. after this happened I have checked with other domain providers such as 123-reg.co.uk and they wont let me do the same it shows it clearly as unavailable. I contacted their customer support chat and the first message i get is: Hello, thank you for contacting Namecheap Live Support! Due to a large number of support requests, our response time is longer than usual. We apologize for this delay and thank you for your patience. I am reviewing your initial message now and will do my best to assist you quickly. And I had to wait 7 minutes for someone to even reply to me. Anyway finally I asked them what happens to my money now. They said it is refunded directly to the source. So I should get a refund in 48 hours. The problem is I am still going to be charged an international transaction charge. Probably another £2 eaten by them because of their stupid system that allows you to buy domains that are simply not available. That is simply false advertising, terrible customer service that tries to make out your a liar and don't know anything and your not the admin of your own server your paying 30 something pounds a month for, they are robbing customers at the end of the day. Id say stay away from them they are terrible, terrible."
"Worse Company online, I made an account with them and bought domains and SSL's with them. My account got hacked and the person doing it changed all the details. Now I can not get into my account. Lost all my ssl's and domains. Support told me to they needed to deiced and never got back to me. I would never give this company money agian. It is a complete SCAM! They do not even desire the 1 star."
"I have used Namecheap for almost all of my domain name and web hosting needs since migrating from 1&1 some time ago. The domain names are very competitively priced and the web hosting packages are well thought out. However, I have yet to find an option with Namecheap that allows us to use something other than CPanel."
"I've used a few different domain registrars over the years, but Namecheap is the one I keep coming back to. Easy to use, but still full of features like the ability to automatically create Gmail MX records."
I use namescheap for all my domains and ssl's I have transferred from godaddy because of their anoying upsells and slow service. NamesCheap has been great!
"As my domains expire, I am migrating all of them to namecheap. The biggest selling point for me was the free dynamic dns they offer, along with the update client. I can finally use my own domain with my dynamic ip address from my home isp instead of mydomain.theirdomain.com :)"
"I've had a horrible last 5 days dealing with NameCheap. I've been billed twice for two out of four purchases, had to contact support to get my products added to my account for two of them, and I'm sick of needing to contact support for every thing I try and do. Buying something should not be this hard. At any other host I've used, I didn't even think about the purchase process itself, it was just like checking out at any online store. It's ubiquitous technology, I don't understand how you can run a business with a storefront this broken. They've been good about fixed issues as they come up, but it seems to be a neverending stream of them! They've yet to refund me for one of the double billings ,but it's almost certainly going to come back as credit, based on how the rep's been handling it. At this point, I don't even care. They've got the money. It's theirs. Congrats, I hope you're happy with a few extra bucks, because I'm not coming back."
"I have been with namecheap for 2 years and have domains, shared hosting and 2 dedicated servers with them. Nothing but good things to say, support is good and they have lots of useful features bundled in for domain configuration. The dedicated servers are on a super fast network and so far had 100% up time as they promised. I rent a SSD package and it is blazing fast. Unless something goes utterly wrong I will upscale with them in the future."
"I cannot leave feedback without giving them 1 star. They dont deserve one star: Namecheap is a nightmare. Cheap yes but they dropped 3 of our domains with out warning. They admit full responsibitlity , losses in the thousands, costs in the thousands and when i complain i get a link sent to me!!! They actually sent me a link...no sorry, no hey we will make it up to you, a link! Terms and conditions. Basically it is my problem! Its in the name - you get what you pay for. Be warned, if you are looking for hosting avoid this company as best you can."
"Not for amateurs, Namecheap is a pretty barebones registrar. If you have the chops and thoroughly understand cPanel, how DNS really works, and the guts of SSL, they are a good choice to save some $. Very good pricing and reliability, and their support is pretty responsive if you paint yourself into a corner somehow. But their site isn't going to hold your hand, it's not pretty, but it works. Minor quibble -- I usually have to contact them to get Comodo SSL certs re-sent manually when I renew them, but they are fast and efficient. EDIT 11/2015 -- Namecheap has completely revamped their site and it is now much more user friendly and sensible. 5 stars now."
"Namecheap sucks they dropped my domain second time in the row first after renewing - they said that forgot to refresh record after I paid (WTH are they doing it manually for milion records? haha nice bullshit) and second time they just deleted record: here some transcription from chat : Eugene *****: Hello! Thank you for contacting our Live Chat Support! Would you please provide me with the domain name? 14:39 me: Hi 14:39 me: ****** 14:39 me: its second time in the row 14:39 me: its not working 14:40 Eugene *****: Would you please provide your Namecheap username and your support pin?

I promise to do my best to help you 14:43 Eugene *****: Kindly allow me a minute to check the domain 14:43 me: OK 14:48 Eugene *****: Thank you for waiting, I have just re-enabled the domain settings. Would you please try to access the All Host Records again? 14:49 me: ok what do you mean re-enabled? 14:49 Eugene Moroz: As I can see, the domain resolves properly form my side now. 14:50 me: why was it disabled 14:50 me: ? 14:50 me: whats happening with namecheap it;'s really annoying I have to check if my domain is in place 14:50 me: all the time 14:51 me: could you just explain me what happened? 14:52 Eugene *****: I am terribly sorry for this situation, it looks like the settings just dropped out from our system. It looks like there was a glitch at the side of the domain Registry. 14:52 me: Ok I think as you can hold single simple domain (Its second time in a row) I have to move all my domains from you 14:55 Eugene *****: As a part of apology please allow me to provide you with our monthly coupon HOTREGXFER while registering or transferring domains. It allows you to: - register .COM domains at $9.66 $0.18 ICANN fee, .NET domains at $11.32 $0.18 ICANN fee, .INFO domains at $9.66, .ORG domains at $11.01, .BIZ domains at $10.21; - transfer .COM domains at $8.84 $0.18 ICANN fee, .NET domains at $10.52 $0.18 ICANN fee, .INFO domains at $9.66, .ORG domains at $10.21, .BIZ domains at $10.03. If anyone want to use cupon - is welcome I cant see any advantage of using it. I am moving from namecheap it may be cheap but their uptime for my single domain is 50% I think its too hard for them to hold domain records in place. Also they are first registrar that have erased my domain ever (and they did second time in a row!!!)"
"I switched from badger.com to NameCheap about 3 months ago because I am pretty sure that the owner of badger.com is either in jail, dead, or has abandoned the business. NameCheap has been great and has all the tools I need for managing my domains."
"The process to initiate a transfer was painless. When I did have a small issue, I got a proactive email from support concerning that issue. The support chats I've initiated have been helpful and resulted in a quick resolution. Their prices are right. Their interface is sparse, well organized, and quick. I don't have advertisements all over the place or long load and wait times for different menus. Overall, I've been very happy with my experience."
"The tech support of this company stinks. It is outsourced to Kharkov, Ukraine, to some guys who don't even have their own website. They are incompetent, unable to solve problems, and they can easily make you mad in less than 24 hours. And it is not a kind of company where tech support is not needed, because everything works without problems. There are problems, support is needed. But with every problem you are on your own, since tech support has no idea how to solve problems. Also, their nameservers come down under DDoS attacks from time to time, and their stuff can do nothing about it."
"BEWARE! I've been hosting websites for 17 years and the last 12 I was with GoDaddy. I hate GoDaddy's ""style"" of business but for domain DNS, they've been rock solid. I never have hosted websites with GoDaddy. I moved one of my domains to Namecheap as an experiment to see if I could save money. Day 1 their system was running super slow and support acknowledged that. Whoa, talk about I guess bad timing? Not a good start. Then a couple months later, all of the sudden, all the DNS entries for my domain vanished! I hadn't logged on in weeks. They said that it was ""probably a bug in their system"" and they didn't have any backups of their DNS server they could use to restore my domain's zone file. WHAT!? Holy crap, if I had transferred all my clients over and this happened it would have been a nightmare. Maybe I should have setup a slave DNS on a different provider as extra protection but that was never necessary with any other provider I've used for DNS. Absolutely horrifying experience. I will be happy to spend an extra few bucks for GoDaddy reliability."
"I have been nothing but happy with Namecheap. Good prices, sweet SSL cert bundles, and very fast DNS. They'll get all of my registrations."
"I just moved 2 domains from Godaddy to Namecheap and saved $30 per year and got free domain privacy! Probably the best part was the actual move. It was by far the best that I've seen in my 20+ years wrangling domain names. The process was streamlined, easy to understand and fast."
Great management tools with no-fluff no the site. Cheap prices and tech support has always been super helpful whenever I have used their live chat.
moving to namecheap there webhosting value plan works great uptime 90% small downtime counter paload.net thanks for sevice offered on us
"I initially only registered one domain with them, but after ONE interaction with their support team, I moved all of my sites to be registered with them. They were super helpful, nice, and timely! Every other registrar I've dealt with has taken days to get to any tickets I've put in."
"My first 12 months went without problem, however when it came to renewal (expiry date 30th June) I was told they couldn't take payment & that I needed to top up my account before the 22nd June so they could take payment, I did... Read More
this & then found my website was deactivated, when I contacted namecheap they told me I hadn't topped up in time & I must pay $214.99 to renew the domain. This was on the 21st June and goes not only against their terms and conditions (domain enters redemption after expiration) but also their own email that advised me of the top up date 22nd June. I would advise to steer clear of these fraudsters. They are not only trying to scamme out of $200 but they have ended my domain service almost 2 weeks early and cost me business as well.

"NAMECHEAP is really a great threat to your business
If you have a great business transfer-out your domains and all other services. 
The policies of this company are sick , they have suspended all of my services because I didn't answer their email after 24 hours!!! ( they suspended every things not only domains) 
how ever after I answered the email the services un-suspended, they just needed some documents.

But why they need to suspended my services while there was no any charge back? I have already transferred-out every thing and recommend every body do same or don't ever buy any important services or domains here.

I suffered from this company when my services was suspended , shame to you NAMECHEAP !!!"
"We use Namecheap for all of our domains. They have the cheapest prices on the market (especially if you get a deal during Black Friday/Cyber Monday). They also have a huge list of .cool new available TLD extensions that you can register. What we like about them is that even though they are cheap, they are still reliable and have great 24/7 support. Finding both cheap and quality products is an unthinkable task nowadays. However, Namecheap is great (for domains). 



Read more of our review:
They really are cheap
With the services that Namecheap offers, you can't really find anything cheaper. You can still find a domain for under a dollar, but the provider will most likely have bad 24/7 support or no free WhoisGuard. Their domains are cheap as it is, but you can get them even cheaper if you buy the domains during a promo (usually Black Friday and Cyber Monday).
They are reliable
You won't suddenly lose your domain. Your website won't suddenly go offline. Their DNS servers won't go offline. They won't block you out of your domains for nothing and not let you know about it. They've been in business for years and they've had positive reviews from the get-go. You can rest assured that you are getting quality services for the lowest prices available on the market.
Great 24/7 support
We wish we kept all of our support chat transcripts we've had with Namecheap. Every time we contact them they are available (and we've contacted them both in the AM and PM, weekends and weekdays). There's little to no wait. Even when we had to wait before, it was just a few minutes and they kindly asked us to wait while they look at our request. Reply and resolution time is usually done in a few minutes, depending on your issue. They are always kind and helpful, even when someone asks a stupid question or has a dumb request.

Their support team actually wants to help you. They don't just point you to their knowledgebase (which is great, btw!), they will help you and guide you through every step of the way. They write in clear English and you can clearly understand their instructions, even though (based on names alone) it seems like they are not from English-speaking countries. We may be wrong, though.
They have all the .cool new gTLD extensions
You can even pre-order and get on the waiting list for some gTLD (generic top-level domain) extensions that aren't officially released yet! Have in mind that these are only generic top-level domains like .rocks. Domain extensions like .com, .net, .org etc. and international extensions like .co.uk are not included in this list, though they are still available at Namecheap. We got a (maybe) exclusive list of all the gTLD extensions available at Namecheap:


  Click here to view 370+ available TLDs at Namecheap
  

Just do a quick CTRL + F and enter your favorite word. There's probably a new gTLD for it.

That's a lot, huh? .com is old school. Get with the times and order an awesome domain with an interesting extension! Your domain will surely be memorable and brandable with one of these extensions
All you need is already there in the knowledgebase
They have a huge, extensive knowledgebase. They have a tutorial for almost any issue you can have with your domains. Even if you don't find a solution in their knowledgebase (or if you're just feeling lazy), you can contact their 24/7 support anytime.
Their hosting services are not the best (though still great)
And that's expected. Mind you, they are still lightyears ahead of some of the bad hosts out there. They generally are a domain provider and they (probably) put more focus on their domain services. Follow our web hosting guide and choose a different provider as a host. You should never get domains and web hosting from the same provider anyway. Get domains from one provider and hosting services from another. You can combine SSLs and Domains from the same provider, though. Namecheap has great offers on SSLs.
IMHO, their UI can be better
Although it is intuitive and nice-looking, their back-end user interface could/should get an update. Some options (like the affiliate dashboard, for example) are sometimes hard to find. Sometimes it can be a bit slow. Their front-end looks great, though.
Conclusion
Namecheap are great. Get (or transfer) your domains there. Preferably, get hosting from a different provider."
"Good interface, easy to get to where I wanted not like *cough*godaddy. Also cheaper!! by about 50% in year 2+."
this is probably the most-well-documented domain-transfer process in the domain-provider UNIVERSE!
I&#039;ve been working with Namecheap for years now and i&#039;m good with them
Easiest and most user-friendly experience I have yet to come across! If 10 stars were an option that is what I would give!
"You&#039;ve made a process that thirty years ago, before AG invented the Internet... in his words., was; difficult, labor intensive, and expensive... almost, too easy.  Thank you!!!"
"I think privacy is important and you appear to think the same. I appreciate that.
Also, your price is very good for what you offer.
Thank you"
"Was an easy transfer from GoDaddy and a cheaper price and love that domain privacy is free 
Already referred you to a few friends as well"
"Came here from GoDaddy. Cheaper Prices, will move the rest of my domains if the interface works as well as the ordering was. :-D Thanks"
"Have used GoDaddy for the past ~ 20 years and have about 30 domains registered there. Their website is slow, and they are always trying to tack-on additional upsells. We have had some service issues in the past, and in all cases, they did not handle things well. I have been meaning to find a new register (and hosting provider), and remember a former IT person mentioning NameCheap. So, I did some quick research, and you had both an easy/fast website to navigate, but cheap pricing on domains (with what seems to be a clear interface and not a lot of sales gimmicks). It&#039;s been a great experience so far. Thanks."
"Wanted to buy a domain thru Shopify to connect my new store, but decided to see if there was a more cheaper options in domain. A couple of google searches later, came across Namecheap. Was first going to go with a (dot)store ending to my buisness, which is Dark Elf Studios, but I saw they had a (dot)studio option. I had to grab it, it was destiny. Price was $20/yr, not to bad honestly. Better than what other places offered. So thank you again for being able to let me have my first own domain for my first ever online store!"
I was recommended by my boyfriend and it he was right! imagine that...:)
Super easy--and the domains I wanted were not available at my previous registrar. Weird but true!
"So user friendly! I am new to all of this, and the experience was not a bit stressful. It was kind of fun. I also appreciate the promotion code; takes the edge off just enough to make me brave ;). Thanks!!!"
It was so easy to use and navigate through the site! I am truly impressed and look forward to registering my other domains through this platform. Highly recommended!
Happy to see that you provide free Whois guard as default and support the EFF.
"easy to use , love the email option , tahnk you"
The only domain provider who doesn&#039;t rip off their customers x
Alot of people have many great ideas for consumers but dont want to take the time to explore all they need or even know. Namecheap had everything i needed in one place and with an appealing price.
"Impressive system.Now anybody can buy domain name online,as easy as 123."
"The order process was seamless, and the rates were the best I encountered compared to other places. Two thumbs up !!!"
"I don't really understand the tons of negative feedbacks, and honestly, I think most of them are paid by competitors.

best option, AND THE ONLY ONE THAT OFFERS A SUPPORT TICKET SYSTEM, while competitors only offer chat and phone - this latter fact is just ridiculous btw.
The only thing I didn't like is speed - if we compare website speed, NameCheap is clearly the worst option. But hey, low cost shared hosting is not for serious businesses where speed is really important.
NameCheap's domain hosting is one of the bests in the market, and their private email hosting is also top notch.
I also really like their UI. It's very user-friendly, very well designed, actually one of the best hosting backend design I've ever seen.

At first I thought namecheap is really good. But now I realize the reality. Customer Support via chat is horrible. They take forever to solve a simple problem. Besides that my website php email stopped working. It needs to install stmp. But that doesn't work at all.

While I was skeptical at first, I ended up being really happy with EasyWP, Namecheap’s managed WordPress hosting. It’s missing some advanced options, and the descriptions aren’t as honest as they could be, but beginners and casual users will appreciate how fast and easy it is to use.
If you’re just starting your WordPress website and looking to minimize confusion, my recommendation is to give EasyWP a try.

"If you're looking for a thorough Namecheap.com hosting review, you're in the right place.

A few short years before the dotcom bubble caused alot of internet businesses to shut their doors, a company by the name of Namecheap was started. Their mission was to offer high quality domain and hosting products at affordable prices.

What is Namecheap? An Overview


Founded in 2000 by Richard Kirkendall, Namecheap is one of the veteran hosting companies in the industry. They've grown massively from a small startup into a giant with 10 million domains under management. They're considered one of the largest domain registrars and hosting companies in the world, and one of the fastest growing American companies according to the Inc. 5000.
How Does Namecheap Work?
As a web hosting provider, Namecheap is most known for managing web servers that offer storage space to businesses who want to market online. Their servers ensure that when website visitors type in their customers' web site address or click on a link to their websites, they will be served the content they want on-demand.

They're able to perform this function for their customers by keeping a team of technically inclined professionals, maintaining they're servers, and staying aware of the continuous evolution of technology.
How Do I Get Started with Namecheap?
Namecheap is most known for their domain registration services. Most people know you can get cheap domain names at Namecheap, which is expected as a result of the business name, however, they offer hosting as well.

To get started with Namecheap, you would have to:

1. Check for your domain availability or put in a request to transfer your domain from your current hosting/registrar

2. Install your CMS (WordPress is top recommended)

3. Begin customizing your website
Who is Namecheap For?
Namecheap has packages available for low traffic and low content sites up into high traffic sites. Their infrastructure can support majority small and medium-size business requirements, and can scale to support many large business requirements as well.
Namecheap Tools &amp; Training
Namecheap has a knowledgebase, a blog, and resource center with articles on internet marketing.
Namecheap Support
Namecheap offers customers 24/7 support by phone, email, and live chat.
What Does Namecheap Do Well

 	They sell affordably priced domains (sometimes as cheap as $0.88!)
 	They make it easy to register domains
 	They provide 24/7 support and help customers navigate technical issues

What Doesn't Namecheap Do Well

 	Customer reviews suggest they ban accounts without notice when they suspect spam. They may need to be more transparent in the customer onboarding process about spam policies.
 	Customer reviews suggest they immediately sell domains if they aren't renewed, and try reselling them to customers for much higher than their previous domain registration cost. They should probably tell customers about the penalities associated with domain expiration.
 	More than one customer review showed messages from their legal and abuse department where customers were asked to send bitcoin to an account # along with their bank statements, credit card info, and other personal information. After customers complied, they noticed additional unauthorized charges on their accounts. I'm no lawyer, but I can't think of any reason why Namecheap should request bitcoin transactions, bank statements, or the personal information they have. If this was an unethical action within their company, they should respond to the negative complaints apologetically, and try to rectify these situations with the customers. Instead, these complaints are reported online with no responses from Namecheap.
 	They don't respond to customer reviews online

Namecheap Review Roundup
Namecheap had very mixed reviews online. Half of the reviews were 4 or 5-star and half of their reviews were less than 3-star. Here's an example from TrustPilot.

After reading several 4 and 5-star reviews and many of the 1 to 3-star reviews, it's clear that some people are having good experiences and some people are having very bad ones. Unfortunately, many of the bad experiences were legitimate issues of ethics, and could probably even be justified in courts if the customers had taken it that far.
Common Positive Feedback

 	They have affordable pricing
 	The website is fairly simple to use
 	It's easy to buy domain names
 	Good service
 	They've always answered my questions

Common Negative Feedback

 	Namecheap had several very descriptive reviews on TrustPilot where people felt they were scammed or fraudulently charged
 	One customer review suggested the customers' .com domain was auctioned immediately after domain expiration, and they attempted to sell the .net version back to him for $88
 	More than one review was from angry customers who had been banned without notice then requested to send private information (bitcoin transactions, credit card statements, articles of incorporation, bank statements, etc.)
 	One customer said he complied with the request for private information, sent it in, then noticed unauthorized charges of nearly $700 on Amazon! He wasn't able to stop the fraud activity without cancelling his credit cards and treating the issue as identity theft.
 	Bad customer support: long response times and limited help

Most Helpful Positive Namecheap Review
Namecheap is awesome! you can't go wrong choosing them.

I use namecheap for domains and private emails hosting, SSL certificates and sometimes I use their shared hosting for basic websites and I love their customer support help whenever I need them I can get my problem solved within a short time, I also love the fact that they are systematized when they assist you, for me it's efficient to be organized that way, also their dns propagation is fast comparing to other registrar I can't recommended them enough, while I am surprised to see some low rating and complaint I have never faced any issue myself being several years with namecheap, and seen big companies using them too, they are very nice, if something keeps me with namecheap so far, it's due to their awesome friendly support! don't listen to what haters says try the service yourself and judge. It's my fair opinion and am happy so far with their service.

Russian scammers from Namecheap

Namecheap support Valeriy Khajitov locked my domain monerochange.pw with big traffic 1 month ago without any reason, he demanded my documents and credit card scans, after receiving this information another worker from Namecheap Alexander Shandyba is demanding 1 bitcoin for unlocking my domain. Also my credit card was charged 1 week ago on amount of 699 usd fraudulently: somebody bought notebook on Amazon with my credit card information. I blocked my credit card, the only persons who received information about my credit card were Namecheap workers Valeriy Khajitov and Alexander Shandyba. BEWARE ABOUT THIS RUSSIAN SCAMMERS FROM NAMECHEAP. I already made report in police. You can go to my domain monerochange.pw now and see that it is locked by Namecheap. Now I also made the freeze of my credit reports because I am afraid identity fraud and somebody can receive another credit cards with my personal details.

Terrible customer service

Terrible customer service. Been on customer chat for over 1:55mins (with Vlada Soldatikhina) regarding them discontinuing the ""Value"" hosting plan and creating a cheaper service and not notifying the customers of the dicontinuation and that the ""value"" plan is no longer the cheapest. Had no apology throughout the conversation except for an automated response 50mins in as I mentioned this. Customer support is very bad and basic. Makes me believe that they are generic online service team and don't have any connection with the company at all. They failed to show me a a breakdown of my old plan in comparison to the new one. They used an excuse saying that I should've signed up to their generic newsletter to be notified of the discontinuation. And when they showed me the article it didn't mention anything about customer on the value plan will/are paying more than they should. I only knew this as I asked a generic question and was surprised to find out ive been paying them more than I should've. I have asked them to notify all their customers who are on the value plan that they are no longer on the cheapest plan and is recommended to get in touch to switch. So if you are choosing Namecheap don't expect them to notify you when they change your plan. Or put you onto a more expensive one unknowingly.

Namecheap Price
Namecheap has VERY affordable pricing, which is a reason many people choose them. Their prices for hosting break down like this...


My Final Opinion of Namecheap
I've personally seen many people who use Namecheap without any problems, however, I wouldn't take the few incidents of fraud and identity theft lightly. I know large companies can have instances where bad customer support happens or even fraud as a result of a bad hire, however, it's a red flag if they don't rectify their actions with the customers.

Out of all of the bad reviews I read, there were no apologies or responses from Namecheap, which is a reason why I'd caution anyone considering business transactions with them. If my credit card information was stolen by a company's staff member, and they didn't agree with the activity, I'd expect an apology at least.  As a result of all of the ethical complaints at Namecheap, I wouldn't recommend the service, but I know some people will still want to take the risk. If you're the risktaker who wants to take a gamble on Namecheap services even after hearing of the fraud and identity theft complaints, you can VISIT NAMECHEAP HOSTING HERE.
Top Alternatives
There are other companies who offer domain registration, website hosting, business email, and other services without having the ethical complaints Namecheap has. Instead of doing business with Namecheap, I'd recommend you choose a company with a clean background record and a monopoly of positive customer experiences like these companies I've listed here...

Wealthy Affiliate (Top Recommendation) - Wealthy Affiliate is the hosting service and domain registrar I personally use and recommend. They have outstanding customer service, their background is clean with no ethical complaints, the features that come along with the hosting can't be found anywhere else in the industry, and you can try the service out for free.

VERDICT: Not Recommended
-------------------------------------------------------"
"I was about to buy a domain from godaddy.com and was having so many issues with promo codes (they give some customers 1.99 domains, other customers 5.99 domains, and other customers 12.99 domains....different pricing for the same domain name (!) depending on the customer) and wasted an hour talking to a support rep. I think that business practice is shady. I was happy to find Namecheap and easily use a promo code and purchase my domain in a matter of 5 minutes. Thank you!"
"Every time I try to check out with a new order with Namecheap, the address page rejects my phone number and says &quot;valid phone number required&quot;. I can&#039;t proceed until I enter the right format, but there is no information on what is considered &quot;valid&quot;. I am entering my phone number correctly. This is very frustrating. I have raised two support tickets and the problem still hasn&#039;t been fixed."
"Simple access with accessible promo codes to get ideas off the ground quicker during this difficult time. 
Free whois guard is something that goes unnoticed by a lot of people but it speaks depth about your company as whole.

Thanks for helping people like me take the first step to changing our lives as simple as possible with no money traps or misleading promo codes."

"I don&#039;t think Creating an account, for a web domain, could be any easier! The application form was Simple and Straight Forward, with Help just a click away, if needed. We truly appreciated how well your Registering Process and Forms were put together! Each Step was Fully Detailed and Explained, which eliminated the need to ask questions. Thanks!"
"In order to select whether I wanted the DDoS protection, I had to go to another site to learn what it meant. I am not a techie, so this added a level of hassle and confusion that could have been avoided with a little bit of explanation. 

I do appreciate the clean and simple layout, and, of course, the price for your service. Time will tell whether the user experience stays positive. Overall, so far so good. :)"
"I&#039;m still a little confused. It shows I bought the domains and also something called &quot;Free WhoisGuard&quot;  I do not know what that is. I really need to register the domains but I did not want to buy something else. Can someone advise me about what additional things I bought and what it will cost.  otherwise, \I think everything is good for registering the domains. If i have done something inappropriately, please let me know.  Thank you, P. Ben Webber"
"everything went smoothly and really pleased with your service. my only problem is that i am new to this and don&#039;t understand terms like dns, and all the other that i have encoutered here. maybe try to add some info buttons to explain things a little more for the newbies like me. i expect with the internet evolving at this rate, it will be so many more others like me buying domains. it&#039;s great but it somehow feels it&#039;s made for computer engineers only.  cheers guys! happy new year! :)"
"Love the privacy whois included. I&#039;d like to be able to get more details about the hosting with out chatting or leaving the purchase page, perhaps a pop up with info such as bandwidth and limits. $17 and change is cheap but options for seeing the next level up if I need more than 20 gb. but don&#039;t make me leave the purchase page.
I would have used you sooner if i knew you took the paypal, maybe add the paypal to your site. I don&#039;t like using cards online"
"I always support Namecheap.  This new account is for the company I am working with.  Yet I have my personal account where I have multiple domains since years ago.   Suggestion: On this actual &quot;feedback popup at the end of the order&quot;, change the scoring stars&#039; color to yellow.  Right now, when I select a star, it goes from light grey to darker grey.  I wasn&#039;t sure if I was actually modifying the stars or not."
"Great pricing! Purchased a domain name for 3 years. Though I&#039;m still unsure if my Free WhoIsGuard will renew after each year automatically for free? I trust it is, since it mentions &quot;Free WhoIsGuard&quot; is free forever. Confirmation on the ordering pages would help. Language regarding that purchase is still a little unclear for me personally. Will probably make sure it renews for free next year as I get close to renewal date."
"I&#039;ve only just bought a site with you, I&#039;ve no idea what your customer service is like yet or how easy it is to use your WP setup. I&#039;d really think that this kinda survey would be better suited a bit later into experiencing namecheap. That said, a friend speaks HIGHLY of your website and your customer service, and I trust his word! So looking forward to using your services. Cheers!"
"I&#039;ve been putting off my domain purchase from GoDaddy to Namecheap for literally years because these things never go as straightforward as planned ... and sure enough my card was declined every time I tried purchasing the domain transfers even though my card has been working everywhere else and has funds. This could just be an issue from the card company, but it sure did validate my world view that technology hates me. But hey, your service is cheap and highly regarded from what I&#039;ve read and includes free WHOIS protection so I&#039;m in."
"It took a lot of looking to determine what I would pay for email service.
It appears you only work on an annual basis. I am working on a political campaign and likely won&#039;t need support for other users I may engage beyond November 3, 2020, roughly seven months, so I want a monthly option. I set up one address for my own use, to test the service, but I&#039;m still considering my options."
"I was dubious of you to begin with and hopefully I am not wrong. I am an ad man and maybe our company could help you communicate your business model better. We&#039;re two international ex-executive creative directors and we have worked in the emcommence space since it&#039;s inception. But your service and offering are really powerful and I think you have a huge competitive advantage over the Godaddy&#039;s of the world that you should build on which you obviously are.

Thanks/Daniel Higgins"
"I was very pleased with my purchase through Namecheap.  I really liked that I could add the free privacy and SEO boost addition to the domain.  I also liked that I was given an option for auto renewal and not just automatically recharged next year.  I do plan to renew but will change this in the settings later.  Quick and easy process, I&#039;m thankful that I found Namecheap!  Thank you!!"
"The comparison charts on your site were key in helping me decide to go with your service over GoDaddy, IONOS, and Domain.com (among others). All researched articles, reviews, and videos pointed to namecheap as best in class. Transferring all domains from active-domain.com and DreamHost.com over to namecheap.com asap. Thank you!! I appreciate swift 24/7/365 live chat support! Hooray!!"
"the process was simple and straightforward. Text on the site was friendly and pleasant. Help was easily reachable. I was transferring a domain and particularly liked having the lock/unlock check right there, with an option to refresh in place. And I really appreciate the warning that I was running out of refresh attempts. One thing I&#039;d suggest is to advice that it can take up to a few minutes for a recently-unlocked domain to become unlocked."
"I have gone through the billing of a good number of hosting companies, e.g. bluehost, and have discovered that yours is far less. it suits beginners like my own company. many thanks for being affordable. But then, I have a little issue with your subsequent billing. In Nigeria, here, if one is renting an apartment or facility, increment comes after a couple of years(say 3-5 years). Anyways, I still appreciate this because, in relation to other companies doing the same thing, yours is better. 
Best regards."
"My initial American Express payment kept getting denied despite the numbers being entered correctly. It kept giving me a &quot;field missing&quot; error, but I did not see any fields missing and the website would not point out which fields it thought were missing. I eventually entered a different credit card, entering the same amount of data in the fields I previously had and it worked fine. Maybe there was some error with American Express? I don&#039;t know"
"So far the experience using your website has been a pleasure. I dont know much about website design, hopefully this will be something that is easy as I&#039;m attempting to establish a sense of professionalism by having a website for my home recording studio, but am on a seriously low budget due to the corona virus pandemic within New Jersey and I am out of a job. Thanks for making things easy so far. Respectfully, Danny."
i found this site to be interesting for helping someone to go to digital. its worth to have your own website with just a low cost start up as all of us in the different location are having downside due to the pandemic that is been happening and all of the people out there are too much affected. Hoping through this start up we could be aiding our self step by step. thank you and God bless and more power.
"I&#039;m so glad I found NC.  I have been going through Godaddy for domains, etc... and always felt it was overpriced, hard to get techs on the phone, and overall felt &quot;ripped off&quot;....I read a review about Namecheap and checked it out, gave it 24 hours to marinate, then came back and bought some stuff!!  Please don&#039;t diappoint me.  I need help and am hoping your techs can explain stuff in an ez, clear manner.  I&#039;m optimistic."
"First off I saw prices on wix (since I already have a website &amp; domains there).Then I recalled a teacher recommended your site for its easy use and affordable prices. So, I deduced to check out the price difference which was significant. To top it off, I googled for a discount online and found one! Just plain simple to me. Will be surely coming back here for more domain names and things. Thank you guys!"
"Well, there are a few very good things here, that makes me give a high rate

1. I didn&#039;t see any hidden fee, everything is pretty clear
2. There&#039;s a free protection app which is a big plus too
3. I used a coupon for a 30% discount and end up with a very nice final price

Just one thing I didn&#039;t like was the very long process of the purchase, but maybe there can not be any shorter version of this process, so it&#039;s fine."
"I asked a few of my friends on which is the best domain purchase registrar. Many of them suggested the larger known brands in the market while just 1 of them suggested Namecheap. I decided to read up more and heard some great reviews and nothing is untrue about that!!

What I loved about Namecheap:
Simple search to checkout process, No confusing intermittent purchase options, No hard-selling of add-ons and quick Chat support."
"Namecheap over anything else with Joomla, always! I chose the Power package of their three business class packages, and I'm not disappointed. Growth via performance, marketing reach to all social media, search engines, etc. through their immaculate advertising credits has been really helpful for me to expand my business. Thanks to Namecheap in making me a business mogul."
"I totally agree with you Adam. Just like the name, cheapest services."
"NameCheap is one of the popular hosting services chosen worldwide and for a reason! They have got an amazing team which is up 24/7 for any assistance, hence making it very customer friendly. It is very smooth and makes it very easy to run any software. The service is highly professional and totally reliable."
Right An. Really NameCheap is undoubtedly the best! All issues are resolved quickly. Amazing tech support.
"Popularly known for domain registration, NameCheap is a favorite among Joomla hosting users for its flexibility and the level of customization that they offer. I personally like the flexibility they provide to choose the location of the data center my website uses to ensure proximity. The only thing that made me regret picking NameCheap is the absence of hotline support. This for me is a deal breaker."
Choosing namecheap was one of the best decision I have ever taken. It is working great for my small business. Namecheap is just great in terms of speed. The SSL certificate helped me in saving my website from getting hacked. All over my experience with Namecheap has remained amazing.
NameCheap is known to provide impeccable data storage through the help of SSH technology. This feature helped me a lot to recover the exclusive data of my website. The loading speed of the website is unparallel as it made the page of the website load in a short time. To make it a more attractive prospect NameCheap also supports Joomla. This feature helped me manage the content on the webpage in an efficient manner.
"Hosting is terrible, but what is worse is their support team, which reply you politely but in fact answer to something you’re not asking about, either they don’t do anything, or they do what they haven't been asked to do, but not what they were asked about."

Worse I was blocked from logging onto my website and they did not have my email on file. So my simple email did not work, and my email was not working either. I was dumbfounded. I checked my receipt and my email was spelled correctly and LISTED ON THE RECEIPT.
THen some douche wanted all my private information, way more than needed to reset my account. There is no way I'm giving out my phone number from some Indian to scam me. These customer service agents, don't even understand how the proces work It was quite clearly on their own website that my issue was related to unlocking the IP on their end. The person I talked to who could not solve my problem was Prabaharan A. I hope they fire him.
I do not recommend ever considering this company. It is bizarre that they can't make this work. I read on their own website that in the case of my situation they needed to reset the IP. They refused to do that.
If you want to have stroke talking to a wall with long long delays before getting a response, and people asking questions you already answered, sign up with this worthless company.
They won't cancel my account now, so I will have to dispute this with my credit card company.

nd no good support was being received in support. And my website files were deleted from me. So I saw that there was no daily backup store in the backup, it was the backup available of the last month. And he had mentions Daily Backup, Weekly 2 Backup and Monthly 1 Backup, so there was no backup in the server. I want to say this much to you. Do not waste your time here, do not waste money. The worst hosting of my life is namecheap. I lost my website and no backup was available.

Great management tools with no-fluff no the site. Cheap prices and tech support has always been super helpful whenever I have used their live chat.  
moving to namecheap there webhosting value plan works great uptime 90% small downtime counter paload.net thanks for sevice offered on us  small downtime on webhosting compare to other host 
"I initially only registered one domain with them, but after ONE interaction with their support team, I moved all of my sites to be registered with them. They were super helpful, nice, and timely! Every other registrar I've dealt with has taken days to get to any tickets I've put in. Fast, Friendly, Cheap, and I've never had a major issue. And they've been quick to solve any issues I have had with one small exception (see cons.) Also supports MFA for added account security. Buying SSL through them (which they get from Comodo) was a pain, but I use Let's Encrypt Certbot now.
  Their app could also use a bit of work. It sometimes shows deals that you have to use the website to get, and their MFA through said app could be streamlined a bit."
"The issue written on the ticket is really crucial. Its the only way to get to the correct person to fix your problem. If you get a response from the wrong department; you will not get help to resolve your problem. You won't find out until you get a response from the wrong department. But if you keep trying, you will get a response from the department that can resolve your problem."
"wow so this website has a tracker on it linked to some random country. if you do not buy a domain after you search it, someone else will. but i didn't know this and they charged me cause i checked out with it already in my cart. awful awful services."
"Don't use Namecheap to host your website or register your domain. They cater to sexist, rapey, sociopathic cyberbully stalkers who set up websites to harass, defame, dox and destroy the reputations of women and men. When you complain they do nothing. They have no means of contacting them via phone either. They have no standards or terms of service for this type of behavior. They don't mind who sets up a service so long as they get paid, so long as it's ""legal"". I mean, technically I guess it's legal to sexually harass and bully people via the internet through search engines and websites. So if you're a sick, twisted, useless, rapey, stalky, bullying asshole, go for namecheap, I'm sure you'll fit right in with their messed up policies."
"I'm not sure about the other reviews, but I found namecheap to have the best prices on Domain Names and the hosting (I have the middle range shared hosting) is fast, very fast. I had 1and1 and have been experiencing slowdowns - NameCheap hosting responds quickly and best of all it is CHEAP. Compare what you get from other host and give them a try. I'm only paying $5 a month for what 1and1 is charging $9 a month."
"Suspended my domains without cause or informing me and impossible to reach in an expedited manner. CS on chat is entirely helpless and the risk folks responsible are all hiding somewhere in the Ukraine. This is not cheap and good, it's just cheap."
"Even though the prices are cheap, they sell your phone number to spam callers. It's not worth your time and seek some other company like Bluehost."
"absolutely the **worst** hosting service on the planet!!! be warned. all of their support is outsourced. you will **never** find a phone number or talk to a real person. you will never find the business address, phone number, or talk to an employee. their billing systems don't work often, and they will null route your server if your payment is 3 days late. , today namecheap blocked **all** of the emails our servers were sending because some script they were running though we were sending spam. (12 hours later and we still talking with outsourced, level-one support people and we can't get this fixed.) unbelievable!!! worst hosting service ever!!!"
"Namecheap domains are in no way cheap and the company lacks ethics. They will auto-renew for a second year at an inflated price, without warning, even if your card is expired. You can't get a card number out of their system, once it's in. They spend more time/money protecting their unethical policies with loop-hole laws than they spend in domain management. BEWARE, STAY FAR AWAY!!"
They don't seem to mind activity that's in violation of their acceptable usage agreement... or they just don't enforce it. They also don't list any contact info in their whois and the email correspondence I've had with their legal team I could of been talking with a broken bot. I mention harassment and disparagement and they reply about bulk e-mail. I ask for their registered agent and they tell me I need a subpoena to get customer info - not what I asked for. Trying to get their registered agent address to send a cease & desist before I proceed in local court with a criminal and civil complaint against them.
"These guys take your money, give you assistance that isn't isn't help, ask for pin codes, which when you get them don't work. I wish you had a way to give them an F-. They should be closed down for grand theft fraud. These folks are not cheap if you value your time and emotions and the shoddy work they do"
"Every one star on this is dead on, they will play you, they will take what you have paid for and rackateer you into paying more, their support is non existent, just cheap, stay away"
"Worst host providers ever. I'm not too technologically minded, so you know, if I know it's bad advice, then it's REALLY bad advice. I asked for them to fix a problem because their servers regularly lock me out. They insisted it was because of my IP address but I have many that I use regularly and they ALL were having a problem. But the just insist they just need to white list it. Fail. Can't log into the CPanel because it rejects my password, but the password generator isn't sending me a link to reset. have to ask the host providers to fix it, and they say no it's a problem with my email provider....(I changed it 3 times to different providers...still not reset emails sent...). Website broke because it was changing my external link URLs. I did my own troubleshooting but found that plugins and themes disabled, the problem still existed. So I again, contact them. They ended up essentially tearing my entire website apart, and then they handed it back, in pieces, saying ""There. It's fixed."" (It wasn't btw, it still was doing that."" SO ask them what was causing the problem and they said, ""I dunno. We didn't write it down so...Start putting your website back together and test it a lot and you'll find it."" I put 2 or 3 things back up, when it breaks in a new way, where I can't even get to my plugins. It says fatal error. I know the code needs debugging, but I don't think it's a coincidence they handed me back pieces of my website, and now it's broken even worse. I went back and asked them to debug for me since, to me, they broke it. They said debugging is my responsibility and to hire someone myself. I said...no. You do it. YOU broke it. YOU fix it. They refused and told me that I probably did somethin gto break it myself (within the 30 minute window I had it back to what they deemed ""working"" condition). I've been with them 40 days. There hasn't been a single day that I did not have to go to their customer support to fix something else that randomly broke. Servers locking me out, my entire website being missing, 404 pages for no reason, out of the blue...and EVERY single time I've had to chat with them, it's been at least a 3 hour adventure. It takes them a minimum of 10 minutes just to verify you. They ask for your login and a pin...you tell them....and at least 10 minutes later they'll tell you it's verified. It's like they forget they were working with you or something. Oh and nothing, I repeat NOTHING is ever THEIR fault, despite all these issues. It should be basic. Go build a site on wordpress. I've done it 100 times. NEVER had so many problems doing something so simple. DO NOT USE."
"Name cheap.com has to be one of the worst hosting services I have ever used in 20 years. I set up 2 factor authentication and the phone number associated with my account was no longer valid (this happens a lot when you change company phones). I tried every possible way to renew all of my domains which were set up on auto renewal but I was unable to retrieve a code going to this old phone number. Therefore, I lost all of my domains."
Only use this site if you want your phone ringing a million times a day with calls from India offering you website services. If I would have known then I would have gladly paid more to another company and not receive more spam than a Hawaiian lunch buffet..
My company needed a domain change away from wix because they are really expensive so I went with cyberconsults .org and they offer premium service and it’s worth it
Bad service . I lost my money .. scammers
"They don't have ALIAS and ANAME for DNS Records. But they have CNAME. I had very hard time configuring my Node JS app (hosted on namecheap) with their Domain.
Their customer support officers are not knowledgeable. Few of them done wrong thing without asking my permission.
Now I'm planning to transfer my domain (shihabiiuc.com) to somewhere else because I’m sick and tired of using this guys with nothing to show for it, with immediate effect I migrated my domain name off their platform with support from cyber tech firm... help number was 12012979269 and they helped migrated me over with ease... I now use Go daddy I’d say thankful.."
"I have experienced a very poor service by namecheap customer service desk. In fact they could install a speaking or writing computer as they are solely able to repeat sales and contract conditions - when there is a problem it´s only solvable by paying huge money or decide to leave and look for alternatives.
One day late with a renewal payment in May 2020 meant I was kicked out. Mind you: one day late still means 364 days advance payment! instead of 365....
I was extremely disappointed by such poor treatment. If I applied the same treatment to my clients (I am in servicing business too) I could hardly maintain a customer base."
Very bad service and all promises was fake. Please stay away from namecheap.
"AVOID.

They ignore cancellation requests and will try to bill you for services you don't want.

Poor customer service, system designed to make it nearly impossible to get out of your subscription.

Cowboy of a business

(in reply to your comment I requested to cancel all service 2 years ago, which you have ignored, the email account and phone number no longer exist, no payment will be made, sick of going round in circles with namecheap, I’m done uaihgvtger platform and been in search for reliable ways to help migrate my domain and reviews about techcyber came a long way after we spoke on what-app... 12096904390 I was migrated with ease.."
"Wanted saying my website been go so far I’d say, cause you always find it easy to navigate through but for tech and non tech personals, their website so is like if your clients get redirected to your website it always comes late and I don’t now know this is happing, hav even calling the support team to help walk me through the process and not even a response from them, well I thought of positive ways to help migrate my website and all contents over to a better host and immediately I spoke to tech firm on 12012979269 they handled the whole migration process"
"I need to give namecheap negative -1,000 points:
Since May of 2019 I've tried to cancel my account with namecheap but was not able to, I couldn't access my account, I've sent them email after email messages, telling them I needed to cancel. 

I had my user ID and password, but that weren't enough to access my account, a security code was to send to my cell phone, but they put a bogus phone number in my account, so I couldn't receive the security code.

Well, they billed my credit card, I disputed the charge, and the charge was returned to me by my credit card, since namecheap put the charge as re-curring charges, my credit card told me if they do that again next year the charge would be reversed.

Well, they did it again, again I needed them to correct the bogus phone number and let me access to my account to update my account, this went back and forth several times, but I just couldn't get them to correct the bogus phone number. 

The following ticket is the last ticket I have with them wanting to correct the phone number, (I changed the last digit on the ticket)  (the subject re: account password reset is supposed to be ""to correct the phone number"")
       
   Ticket ID: AWZ-805-1605X
   Subject: Re: Account Password Reset
   Department: General
   Type: Issue
   Status: Awaiting Staff Response
   Priority: High

They never took care of this ticket. Today they sent me an email message saying they tried to get the payment from my credit card but failed, and they would continue to try tocharge my credit card, and accused me for not updating my credit card info in my account (which I couldn't get an access to).

This is the message from namecheap to me:
          Payment on your auto-renewal for the subscription listed below has
          failed. No payment has been processed at this time.
          We will continue to attempt to charge the card on record. Please 
          update your payment information.

Of course the attempt to charge me a payment from my credit card failed because my credit card has built this info into my account about what namecheap has done.

I will continue to demand access to my account to update my account, at some point I'll find out if I can go to court to sue them."
"I have been with namecheap for ten years now. I have a number of small problems on site that I need help with. The support pages are impossible to use, surely they know that people use sites like 
Namecheap because they don't have the skills or time to learn how to make a site on our own. Come on, put an email support and a chat line up. I will have to cancel unless help is forthcoming cause it’s been a nightmare hosted by this company, they’ve got nothing to offer you, migrated my store with immediately effect and reviews about Techcyber made everything possible immediately we spoke on 12012979269 and they migrated me beforecsn hour..."
Frustrating on every level
"So I use namecheap (not listed), and I must say, it's pretty great! I get unlimited bandwidth, great customer support I don't even mind contacting, and pay a mere 20$ a year for hosting and domain. All in all, it's a great service."
"I have only one complaint and this is APACHE SERVER BASED, they use a module which is there for security reasons, but it also creates problems when running Drupal 7/8 in an advanced way, limiting communications and functions.

However the support was quick to resolve the problems and whitelisting what I needed, so I really can't complain about anything.

Despite the price in % being upped, I still think they are really cheap for the quality they give compared to HostGator, where everything worked 100% right away, but later some hiccups occurred.

All in all, I like both of these hosting company's, but for different reasons."
"If you think their web hosting is bad -- wait until you try their email hosting. I've been with them a year and I should have switched after a month. Email is constantly down for an hour here or there. I'm talking 30 times a year. Load times are extremely SLOW. I cannot tell you how many times I thought I ""sent"" an email, but forgot to keep the browser window open the requisite 10 seconds afterwards to allow the email to actually send. Then the email is lost, and I have to retype the whole thing. And currently they are running a push to sign up MORE email accounts? This will likely make things WORSE."
"I thought I'd try their managed Wordpress accounts, so I signed up for the EasyWP Turbo package. After submitting my financial info (and charging my card), it asks for a domain name and I used one of many I have registered with a company other than namecheap. AFTER TAKING MY MONEY, I find out that you can not buy a EasyWP Turbo account UNLESS the domain name is registered with them. Absurd. I contacted support and here's what they told me: ""Unfortunately, the use of the Easy WP service is currently limited to domain names registered with ourselves..."" I've been building web sites since 1996 and this is the FIRST time someone tried to force me to buy a certain product before they would sell me a hosting package. I told them I'd take my business elsewhere."
"I use namecheap for my 7 websites. They are not complex sites, couple of them wordpress, others are just HTML CSS and I am happy with my choice. Actually over the years I have seen the worst. A lot of company that are just trying to catch new customers while they charge a lot of money for old customers. So I am happy actually that I found this company. Affordable prices, service is same with many others. I am using the europe server."
"My hosting service was up, decided to try NameCheaps EasyWP for my three sites (blogs, forums, testing) and they have failed in every way possible. Uptime of around 60%, I'm constantly kicked from my admin account do to server caching errors. Support is quick to respond but fixes aren't taken care of for days. The server security needs improvements. The equipment used for EasyWP is not disclosed and I couldn't get anyone in support to list them. Not a CPU, not any RAM, nothing. NameCheap support is also very wrong on many things and it's hard sometimes finding someone who actually has any knowledge. The price was so cheap it brought me in, but the headache is not worth it. I am a content creator, YouTuber, and avid tech lover. I review and test out the best and worst products in the field every day, and I can definitely say that NameCheap is the worst WordPress hosting service out there I have ever used. Better stick with HostGator, GoDaddy, Kinsta, etc. because you will regret it. EasyWP is not in Beta, it is in Alpha."
"Shopify does not allow the certifying of third party domains from Namecheap. Before buying any domain. Namecheap should have a pop up for each customer to ask them who their Host is and Notify them accordingly if the SSL certification would be applicable or not. ... Since late 2017 I've had two domains from Namecheap connected to my website and they Decreased my organic reach right after I added them to my google search console for Crawling ... Besides slowing my website upload time to 11 - 15 seconds when marketing campaigns started.

Which I believe is due to a mixed up Google bots about these Namecheap Domains being none certified http ( Shopify will not give CSR code ), and being again Certified within Shopify under the shop's Primary domain in whole , as an https ... Resulting in Many Warnings to my links when checking my primary domain in google search console reaching the thousands of warnings, and a dead organic reach.

Besides that, Namecheap still does not have TLS certification which is the most updated certification process with Servers."
"Your review was spot on for me. Namecheap service started out fine, then got worse.

For example, uptime was good for awhile. Then came problems. I had to purchase ""Premium DNS"" for key sites. Not much, maybe $5/YEAR x number of sites, but that's what I thought I was paying for with my VPS in the first place.

Your description of customer service is spot on as well. Lots of links to the Knowledge Base (some relevant, some not), but no real direct answer. The reps are certainly not in the USA, maybe Russia, not sure. They only seem to understand key words, but nothing complex. I have spent days, and have gone through 5 or 6 reps (and different Knowledge Base articles) before I get one who seems to actually comprehend the issue.

In sum, not the worst web hosting I have experienced, but not one I would recommend either."
They proclaim their company goals from the start... They offer cheap domains and bare bones hosting. What you get for $30 a year with them you have to spend almost $100 dollars with anyone else. I've hosted 10+ sites with them over the past 5+ years... They aren't going to hold your hand on your side of the site because their cpanel does almost everything for you already. And any larger problem I've ever had they fixed on their side in a timely manner. You can either get the cuddles from the competitors for 300% more than what you pay with Namecheap or go and get a free site where they can carry you all the way. This one I've found for the price and features is a gold mine for those not scared to work and get to work... Best of luck to you all...
"I've had my Wordpress websites on four different hosts and just moved to NC three months ago, and I've discovered they are the best hosting company I've been with so far. Their site load times are fast (three times faster than iPage and faster even than my friend's WP site on Hostgator, their Softalicious Installer works perfectly, and they have an astounding amount of help files available if you run into trouble.. and if you can't find what you need their chat personnel have been great so far, even following up via email after I got cut off. They also offer free SSL certificates, and if you need a ""verified"" one you can get them at a reasonable rate.. and best of all, their unlimited hosting cost less than half what other web hosting companies are charging.

Dr. John Michael Christian"
"I'm unsure if Namecheap has significantly improved since the time of writing of this article, but most of the cons seem to not have applied to me. The pricing is presently much cheaper than mentioned in this article and the customer service I received in the past year with multiple conversations with their support staff was stellar. I never once needed to reach out to them twice for any one issue.. it was always resolved right away. Sure their support staff takes time and you have to be patient, but they seem to get the job done! Not sure about uptime (which may still be a valid con), but in terms of speed, my website seems lightning fast compared to my old (and pricier) host, Godaddy. Gtmetrix scored my website 99 percentile for load time. So basically namecheap has been cheap, helpful and very efficient!"
"Having registered a few domains at namecheap, I know it's often a miss. Always something goes wrong. When I had my domain up and running, I bought their email service. As part of that, they wiped out all my DNS settings. Yesterday, I set up a new domain, and changed the DNS. None of the DNS settings got propagated, and, according to their abysmal support, it was my browser. After talking to a few support people, I'm still not 100% convinced their support aren't bots.

Overall, namecheap is incredibly bad, and not worth the effort. Better spend 2 dollars more, it will save you a lot of time."
"I am not a tech guru but I have websites hosted by GoDaddy and Wix for over 5 years now. On both NEVER have my sites been hacked, BUT! I have a very important website hosted by Namecheap for about 2 years and it is currently down and has been down for almost a year, they keep saying it is fixed and it keeps getting infected again with malware to the point where I have to probably pay to have malware removed and move to another host company as they do not seem to have a permanent fix for the site. Customer support is friendly but sadly quite useless as they never fix the issue and keep sending me ""articles"" on their site for me to fix the issues myself. How can my ""Local PC"" have issues from a site that is cloud based? Also malware checks show there is malware on the site when I sent the link to them, they sent me a link to another self help article. Never had similar issues with GoDaddy or Wix. So I am looking for a new host now. I'd pay more money for better website security and tech help."
"I've used Namecheap hosting in 2013-2014 or so for a medium sized WordPress website and left them because I thought it kinda sucked. The site was slow and clunky. Cancellation was not as hassle free and finally I decided to just ignore them and move on. However, over the years I kept using NC for my domains (I have about 10 registered via NC) which has always been great. So in 2018 I decided to try their Stellar hosting package again for a simpler HTML website (www.arnan.me).

This experience has been much better. I renewed a couple of months back and didn't even think to look elsewhere. The site is fast and, as far as I can tell, always online and everything just works as it should. Renewing didn't see a 300% price hike as the review says it would. And even my SSL certificate, which could be easier to install, renewed fine and installed within hours from ordering - Though THAT process could be improved and simplified a lot... But it works, so no real issue there."
I messed up everything but these people helped me with my issue continuously for 3 hours. And they solved my problem. They did everything they could. And i am not gonna leave this Platform. I am very very very happy with their hosting customer service.
"I've been using these guys for a couple of years and in general they've been fuss-free. Today though I found out my emails were down. I tried to trouble-shoot the issue with Google but their support wasn't online so I looked into my domain. Turns out that it hadn't auto-renewed and I hadn't been notified that both my emails and my website would go down. So I contacted Namecheap via LiveChat. My case was simple - I needed to renew and couldn't get into my emails. They asked me hundreds of inane questions, didn't give me any details that I asked for and I had to end up creating an account and paying. The end result? No idea - they say that everything will be back up in 24 hours. Short answer - don't use them."
"Was experiencing issues with site performance and uptime after the first month. Namecheap suggested that if I upgrade my package to a wholly managed server, all issues would be resolved. I then spent every day of the next two months writing back and forth to them, using an outside email since my emails stopped working entirely. My entire business communications were shut down and we had to find a third party solution to help us. Namecheap was completely useless. What's the point of paying hundreds of dollars a month for them to do absolutely nothing? I was two months and well over 500 dollars just in that time-frame, not to mention the additional time and money and energy I had to spend on solving the problems Namecheap caused us. I hated every day I spent under Namecheap."
"I received an email from namecheap legal team that my account had been suspended because my database was receiving 'many queries'. These people suspended my account without warning because my database was doing exactly what databases do! Instead of asking me to upgrade my plan, they go ahead and mess up my business, and apparently, their support team can’t do anything about it!"
"I am currently on Namecheap. I moved there last month after an Ipage episode. Big mistake! Namecheap's Hosting services are far under the web norm. Servers are extremely unreliable. Lost production time is a constant dealing with servers that don't respond, servers that are overloaded, servers that are consistent with never ending stalls, delays, and lags. Whether navigating the website itself online or trying to get something done in the admin, it's an ongoing delay after delay just moving from one page to another or waiting for something to simply save or update. Using Dreamweaver is out of the question; sometimes it will connect, most times servers are bogged down or don't respond.

Support is pretty timely and is done by on site support ticket or directly via email, no phone support at all. They also have an on site support live chat which is never any help. Email help is not bad, they answer pretty quickly and address the issue at hand rather than posting canned responses.

The hosting options available are mostly the norm using an older version of cPanel. Some operations and setups can be very unnecessarily complicated and confusing but they will help with most by ticket or email.

The main problem with Namecheap is their servers reliability. Your websites will go down often too. To add onto the problems pile, all these issues occur anytime, even during business hours. I'd think more than twice before recommending them or using them again.

One plus: Namecheap's hosting prices are affordable in comparison which is what drew me there."
"I have several websites that I host that have been registered with Namecheap. Generally speaking their support staff have been responsive and helpful.

However the more critical issue has been the loss of DNS records without any security breach that caused a client to go dark.

I had another account I manage separately that had it's contact email change, effectively locking me out. Then I had to go through the whole complex process of proving who I am (even though I had all the receipts for payment, etc). Now I have to drive > 200 miles to and take time off to help this non-technical person create a ticket!

If their system was really up to snuff it would:

1. never allowed the changes to occur.
2. had adequate audit records which would reveal how the changes occured and by whom.
3. contained the chats that I went through to initially register the account for him after the automatic mechanism refused to register the domain. They had reversed this at my request!

In short, they seem to be a bunch of fresh out of the university students who have nothing but the rules and little about American business practice. (they are all from Ukraine).

I think the only way to get the matter accomplished is to use a trusted American provider. Funny is that it's not going to cost me that much more."
"I'm running +20 websites on a Namecheap Shared Hosting (Ultimate plan, now should be Stellar Plus) since 2016. Not an issue. Great support. More than 7500 unique visitors per month. Very fast and reliable. Way better than more ""famous"" alternatives. Really, I do not know if this post is about their US servers, but UK based service is really really good. Performance is even better than some crappy/cheap VPS."
"I was a big fan of Namecheap's hosting service for several years, hosting around up to 40 clients across their servers. Everything was great until fairly recently - as mentioned in the initial article there were semi-regular downtimes, which were resolved fairly quickly.

Unfortunately it feels now that the servers are seriously overloaded. This impacts both on your website's connection times, but also on the number of times the server goes down. This is likely a profit-related issue - as in they want to make more money without expanding their server resources. It massively impacts the service they offer.

However, their chat and ticket support has always been a relative high point for me. They are all based in Ukraine, but their English is generally very good. Only very rarely have I experienced poor service, and generally they will stay on the chat with you until you are satisfied. Unfortunately the overloading of their servers is causing problems that their support staff should not be expected to resolve."
"Really like their UX, prices and support."
"Avoid if you want to use your domain name.

I registered a domain at namecheap. Have registered many domains before, this was my second one at Namecheap.

Once I registered, I checked my account. No new domain name added.  I contact support. They tell me there is a problem with their system and they're working on it. I wait and wait. I contact support day after day, wondering where my domain is.  Same story, there's a problem with the system and adding the domain to my account, and they can't give me an estimated time when it will be sorted.  More days pass.  Nothing.  Almost 2 weeks, still not a word from them, but same story from support. 

Meanwhile, try explaining to your boss why you can't use the new domain or why the website isn't up yet.  

I ended up going above them, and found the transfer password for my domain, and I transferred my domain to a reliable registrar where I can access and actually use it. 

Again, avoid, avoid, avoid.  Ridiculously unprofessional.  I'm blown away that a company that specialises in domain registration can't register a domain properly."
"Stay away from Namecheap.

I lost my domain even though I have set up an auto-renew. Why? Because the Namecheap didn't notify me that the card payment didn't sync to confirm the renewal. Yep, that is right! I lost my domain because of Namecheap inferior technology and worse customer experience. 
The solution that the customer service provided me with was to make an offer to purchase the domain again or contact whoever bought it and probably have to pay a lot more to get it back.  
If I only was notified there was an issue with the card payment  I'd update it!! 
Stay away from Namecheap one day it can happen to you!!"
Not bad.. good site for web hosting
"Quality of hosting = very poor, website kept going down 
Customer Service = even worse, every time you get in touch, they ask you to wait 5-7 mins then give you a copy paste answer - they weren't even interested in seeing why my website was going down."
"Horrible customer service. Got locked out of my account because of a password issue. Talked to five people, very automated they all say exactly the same thing and at the end of the day nothing has been resolved."
"Complete waste of money. Support is ULTRA SLOW and just quits the chat after 50 minutes of NOT helping at all.

Their imbecile ""support agent"" Andrey Sokolov just quitted the chat!

Impossible to use even though I am no NOOB at IT.

STAY AWAY!"
I have been with them for 2 year and no problems so far!
"Won't refund for Accidental auto renewal.

Go to other providers such as name.com who will refund if you have auto renewal stuck on without noticing for an old domain."
"Awful service that doesn't explain what you get before paying (I bought a domain without whois guard by mistake because they didn't even say that it wasn't available) took weeks before the registrar removed my information, I was then asked to connect to my account to remove the remaining data, my account was locked for no reason.

I don't even want to use the domain name anymore (and I wont) I just want my data to be removed but the support can't do anything...

Support is awful and can't do anything, uses fake review and comments in YouTube videos. It seems to be the number 2 after GoDaddy... but this is pure scam."
"These guys are pretty awesome. I buy all my domains and Namecheap as well as SSL. They are always very helpful, and one of the cheapest companies around. Their interface is really good for managing the domains, and don’t think I would ever buy a domain anywhere else. Highly recommended."
"They always seem to reply very fast, and when buying domains and SSL certificates you really won’t get cheaper. I struggle to see how some of the other reviews posted have had problems as I have found them exceptional in almost every way. I am actually thinking of upgrading to their new SSD hosting for my ecommerce site, so will let you know how I get on with that in due course. Highly Recommend Namecheap!"
"I use Namecheap only as registrar - and they are the absolute best in that, including support - but one of my favorite blogs (which I visit at least twice a week) is hosted on their shared servers: I never found the site down, it always loaded pretty fast and never showed errors in the wordpress installation. Considering that, I think Namecheap hosting seams good, too."
"I have never used Namecheap web hosting, but for domains and other addons I have used them for years. They have the best management client area, and they really know their stuff when it comes to configuring domains (nameservers etc) and SSL certificates. The prices are great, and I have never had any issues that couldn’t be quickly resolved by their support. As a long time user I couldn’t use anyone else for domains, simply because their domain service is so easy to use… and as their name implies.. Cheap!"
"You cannot get better for domain registrations. Namecheap really know what they are doing and you really can’t get cheaper domains anywhere else, especially with free Whois privacy. I have raised several tickets previously seeking help with installation of SSL certificates and they always respond swiftly with all the information needed.

Whilst I don’t have any of their hosting, I would highly recommend them based on my experiences with hosting all my domains and SSL certificates there."
"Everything was going great, and then I made a big mistake. I purchased a domain name on behalf of a friend, and used their card. That is what I believe must have caused the problem anyway. Namecheap said I had to reply to an email in two days that they sent me about a charge back. I don’t read my email every single day, so I missed it. Then they sent me an email stating that I had lost that domain name I purchased.

I figured I could just use their reliable support. No, I couldn’t use chat support. They locked me out. There also isn’t any phone support. I tried logging into my account. However, they had suspended by entire account. My domain names were all now suspended. There was just one thing I was still able to do which was to open a support ticket with the help desk.

That’s when I really got upset. They took 3 or 4 days to respond to me. All they did was tell me things I already knew. There was no agent assigned to my ticket for around 20 days. I didn’t receive any information about whether or not I would be able to reactivate my domain. So all of my domains and account were deactivated and sitting in limbo. I had to just wait. I was so frustrated and thought I had lost my domains forever. It included a domain that I had an active business site on.

Eventually I got a response. About 3 days later they fixed the problem. I got all of my domains back. However, I didn’t get any useful information from them, and all of my domains had been down for nearly a month. No business should have to put up with that.

Ratings:

With the exception of Risk Management, they had great support. I don’t ever want to have to deal with that kind of problem again in my life. It was the absolute worst. I have to rate it 1 star because it was so bad.

The user interface was easy to use and had all the necessary features.

Until the Risk Management problem, uptime was great. All of my website were down for more than 20 days, and I had no idea if or when the problem would be resolved. That is an unacceptable amount of downtime.

Value. I can highly recommend them if you aren’t trying to run a business and don’t mind if your site could potentially be down for nearly a month. Otherwise, I highly recommend you use a host that offers business class support.

TL; DR: They are great until you can’t use their standard support because you’ve been locked out. My sites were taken down by Risk Management for more than 20 days. During that time, they weren’t answering any of my questions."
"I give them a score of no more than a two, and here’s why:

Pros: competitives prices

Cons: Namecheap has stolen upwards of 10,000 traffic from me by suspending my account. After having over several domains accounts registered with them for close to 10 years, they claimed that I did not verified my whosi guard which I had 10 days to do so, since I did not do it within that time frame.

Therefore I was subject to their 2 Factor Authentication.

I had recently changed my cell phone and my old cell phone number was listed in my Namecheap account. So I could not access it to update it with my new cell phone number, nor could I change it by way of getting a text message from them with my old cell phone. I explained to them they sould have a better system to assist customers to make it as convenient as possible and not to handle the situation like a suspected criminal.

“They claim that they regret to cause inconveniences to me, but this document is necessary for us to make sure that you are the rightful account owner since client security is our highest priority.” Really?

I explained to them that I still can not gain access my account folowing their instruction of “2 Factor Authentication feature”

Namecheap states that once I log into my account I can update via the 2 Factor Authentication feature?

They stated If I am not able to log into your Namecheap account and wish them to remove 2 Factor Authentication feature, please provide them with the following details to verify my account and disable 2 Factor Authentication:

Local address under account: Email address you signed up with: Zip code: Namecheap order ID: Depending on the payment method used - First 4 and last 4 CC digits / PayPal unique transaction ID and email associated with PayPal (if you paid with PayPal or Google Wallet) / transaction reference ID (if you paid with Bitcoin): Domain name:

I had ask their team support previously to by pass this stupid BS step so I can get into my account and update my info, but they insisted to annoy me by taking a firm stance

So who is the real thieves here?

Namecheap claims that they are protecting me from who?

The real crooks have already done their dirty work…..

I have yet to receieve any reply from them since I sent over my Driver License (blocking out my id# like they suggested I do)now I quess they will want my SSN?"
"The support folks say they will help you with services they do nto list like DNSSEC. This is a lie and do not fall for it like I did, I waited weeks for support to do a two minute update. Their security is downright bad….their renewal rates and transfer fees are higher then most registrars. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!

Pros: They are cheap with an easy interface

Cons: Support is awful No DNSSEC support"
"N/A

Pros: cheap, good sales, never a problem with domain.

Cons: I strongly disagree with the fact that they advertise their business on your new domain. And i also strongly dislike how they allow random ads to come up on your domain you just purchased for which they properly get revenue for. ITS MY DOMAIN, DONT USE IT FOR ANYTHING."
"A few years ago I transferred all my domains (over 70) from godaddy to namecheap. Things were fine for a while however in the past couple of months they have changed their customer interface for domains. I contacted support and was told, sorry, get used to it. No option for the previous version of the account interface. New version is not intuitive and makes me have to do two or three steps for what used to take only one.

Sorry namecheap. I will now transfer my domains elsewhere!

Pros: Affordable domain names

Cons: Doesn’t offer a quick way to transfer out your domains to another registrar. Holds on to them as long as they can."
"On 11/10/2013 I purchased a domain name on Namecheap.com, paid $10.87/year and received a confirmation of account approval from them.

Ten days later, I found I couldn’t log in with my ID and password, and therefore I contacted Namechaep. As a result, they said I was flagged as fraud by their system, so they locked my account and canceled my purchase. I’m not fraud! I’m just a normal person buying a domain for my own business.

I was not notified when they canceled my purchase, which was authorized and the payment was received by them. My domain name was then released to the market and was purchased by someone else. As of now, the domain name I legally purchased from Namecheap is owned by a Chinese website. I not only lost my domain name, but lost all my business because that domain name was what I purchased for my business. That was my business name.

I asked for a reason why I was flagged fraud but they refused to do so. I contacted their customer service but they ignored me. They don’t reply to my email in timely manner and try to ignore my questions and requests.

As of now it is December 2015 and I am still struggling on this issue with them. So I asked to delete my account because I couldn’t trust them and did not want to have any business with them. But they keep ignoring my request and refuse to delete my account.

What they did wrong: 1. They refused to provide a reason why I was flagged as fraud. Fraud is a crime. They need an evidence to accuse me so. 2. They canceled my purchase and released my domain name that I paid for without noticing me. I lost my domain name and it caused serious damage to me. 3. They refuse to delete my account. I am the account owner, I have the right to have it deleted. 4. They ignore my request and refuse to contact me or provide a phone number that I can call.

Pros: Cheap

Cons: 1. They cancel your account without notice 2. They release your domain to the market without notice. So if you are buying to domain for business or serious purpose, avoid Namecehap. 3. It took them more than one day (>24 hours) to reply your question. And they don’t understand your question. They even ignore you on purpose. If you need any help, including technical support, it will be a nightmare."
"Transferred from Google to them and I do say that the transfer was a very unpleasant experience. I wasn’t sure what was happening and what was being transferred. When I moved from Godaddy to Google all my DNS settings were moved across. These numpties couldn’t do it and had lots of excuses. My biggest beef was that nothing is explained before the transfer so you are left completely in the dark. Avoid.

Pros: nice interface I guess. But you pay extra for masked whois

Cons: rubbish transfer process and useless support"
"No issues transferring domains. I have a few domains, and ssl packages through name cheap and I’ve never encountered any confusion. The service is incredible. Maybe you got unlucky and ended up with a poor knowledgeable rep.

Pros: Everything is a PRO

Cons: No cons located."
"I am currently NameCheap user and I have more than 20 domain registered with them. I found this Registrar best ever. They provide vip support for every customer and quick response. I plan to use them in future as my primary domain registrar. I have also good experience with Godaddy, NetworkSolutions, iwantmyname, enom, and name.etc."
"their auto renewal process is broken, lost two domains to redemption. Unforgivable.

you cannot call a number and talk to a senior exec. should have checked this before starting with namecheap.

they are reselling for enom, so are limited in terms of what they can do when problems like this arise.

Pros: reasonably cheap and efficient… but see cons. I have been a customer for many years but will now leave.

Cons: 1. their auto renewal process is broken, lost two domains to redemption. Unforgivable.

you cannot call a number and talk to a senior exec. should have checked this before starting with namecheap.

they are reselling for enom, so are limited in terms of what they can do when problems like this arise."
"I have purchased two domains through NameCheap however in the past year I stopped managing one of the sites and assumed I would just let the domain run out/lapse. I received an email saying my WhoisGuard would be renewing in 1 month (from the email date). I did not receive any notification that the domain itself had renewed, which took place on the day the email was sent.

I contacted customer support and asked if they could cancel the renewal and refund the money. The first support agent I spoke with simply told me “That is not our policy” and the chat ended. I then got an email saying that I had ended the chat before it had finished and that they do offer a “one-time” reversal, but it’s subject to review by their staff and isn’t guaranteed. They also kept mentioning that it would be $200 to get the domain back later on if I wanted to renew it (which I had no intent of doing, but they kept warning me about the $200 fee). After chatting with another support agent for twenty minutes they were able to authorize the reversal but asked me to hold while they contacted billing. Another twenty-five minutes later the agent sent a message “I’m sorry, is there anything else I can help you with today?” So I sat there for 45 minutes waiting for them to resolve this and they forgot they were even talking to me.

A couple days later I received confirmation from their billing department saying that the reversal was approved and that the funds “had been credited to my account funds.” I checked my NameCheap account and the money was not refunded to my bank account, it was simply credited to my account on their site. So I contacted support for the third time, told them the whole process is ridiculous and demanded they refund the money to my bank account. “Sir, it is not our current policy to refund to bank accounts….” they replied. I informed them of both previous conversations I had with agents and said I expect my money to be refunded. They then informed me they can refund it but there’s a $0.99 processing fee. I demanded they refund the money and not charge me for it. I stated that I wasn’t informed of the renewal, I wasn’t informed that the “refund” wasn’t going to my bank account and that I will not be paying to have the money refunded.

It has been 30 minutes and I’m still waiting for the agent to reply. They said they were contacting billing."
"Terrible support. Issue with Google Apps left me absolutely furious

When I bought my domain from Namecheap, I bought 1 month of Google Apps (no option to auto renew at point of purchase).

The subscription expired and I had to access to my emails, files, calendar etc. Clients were contacting me and I was losing potential business. I spent literally days on live chat with Namecheap, paid them more money to re-activate the subscription, but after 3 whole days, nothing had been done, even after taking my money.

There was also a “critical” support ticket that received very slow, unhelpful responses. I was just told to wait and wait and wait.

In the end I contacted Google directly who are now asking them to disconnect my account so I can be billed by Google directly.

I will never use Namecheap again and advise that no-one else does either. In a time when I really needed help, and with an issue that should only take 1 hour to fix, even after taking my money, they absolutely left me feeling abandoned and in the dark."
"I’ve never had so much trouble setting up a website and email before registering my domain name with this company. I’ve literally wasted a month trying to get my website and email up and running!!

When I do live chat with them, they’re barely there answering. It can take up to 10 minutes for them to answer a simple question. when I write”are you still there?“, they answer after a minute or so, “yes”. I then have to ask if they read my last question and then it’s silence again. Worst customer service ever.

I want to cancel with them but they won’t refund my money because that’s their policy. They keep the money and that’s your tough luck. Go somewhere else and save yourself the headaches!"
"I purchased around 17 domains with namecheap in Nov 28, 2014, my last update to renew the domains was invoice ID 23231187 on Oct 25, 2016. Today i noticed something weird with one of my domains, the emails was not working and the mx records and nameserver changed, but when i logged in to my namecheap account the nameservers was still correctly pointing to the custom name servers i have set when i bought the domain. So i contacted live support and first was told that this domain is no longer registered with Namecheap. There is ghost record in our system !!!! so i asked how is it possible, since i renewed it and it is still showing active in my account on namecheap. I was then told – “According to our check, the issue was caused by a one-time glitch in our system, as the result, the domain renewed in the order 23231187 on 10/25/2016 did not have its expiration date updated to one more year, regretfully.” So that mean all 17 domains i renewed and paid for is now lost because of a glitch !!!!!!!!! I renewed the domain domain on Oct 25, 2016 and it is still showing active in my account !!!!!!!!!! I was then offered a coupon to register a new domain === what a slap in the face — i had 7 sub domains on the lost domain, each with 5000 mail accounts , so it mean 35,000 email accounts is now lost and i need to go explain to my customers that all their mails are gone…. and that is just 1 of 17 domains !!!!!

I have always spoken highly of namecheap but this is really outrages when your registrar lose 17+ domains of yours because of a glitch then they offer you a $20 coupon . I am sorry but i think that it is time to move to the competition with all my domains .

Will wait and see what their investigation comes up with

Please see Namecheap support ticket : BED-388-82546"
Adriana was clear and direct in responding to my questions.
"I have been using Namecheap for a few months, and have had about 5 minutes of downtime between about 50 websites. (in the middle of the night) For the cost of what they offer (I am using multiple re-seller accounts) and the fact that your domain and DNS is right there too, it’s super-convenient and a great value. OF course you really aren’t supposed to put all your eggs in one basket. But… 10.00 versus 15.00??? (Domain Registrations) As long as you are plenty technical-savvy. If not, it’s not the best choice for a host. I migrated from Bluehost which has turned to be a nightmare in 2015 ⁄ 2016. (BH used to be awesome, 2013-2014) at least for me. Took weeks to migrate everything correctly by myself, but it was worth it. + PROS: 2.00 SSL - CONS: No Phone Support"
Began to use their services for domains and SSL. I considered using their VPS and dedicated hosting and began chatting with their support two times to understand all details. All clarifications were provided by experienced and welcoming. Began to use their hosting a few weeks ago and I find their services dazzling! They make available a wealth of tools and well prepared documentation. Their support people are nice and helpful.
"Bad Bad Bad SERVICE! We had downtime twice in the last 3 months, first time was over 3 hours, second time over 8 HOURS our business went down. No contact phone number only online Chat with people that don’t understand language well. Highly NOT recommend this service!"
"Namecheap offers all the features needed for getting my WordPress website up and running. I didn’t have any problems getting them to work with them, who is my web hosting service. Anytime I needed some technical help, they were always available via chat. It seemed like their chat support people were efficient, polite and knowledgeable. I thought they were a company I could rely on. They also had great prices. I discovered they was headquartered where I live, and that was another reason why I wanted to go with the company. As a domain name host, they were great overall."
"I can prove everything I say with emails, copies of chats and head to head email disussions as well as forum encounters. They have: lied to me misdirected talked down to me mishandled my funds Held me up on domain moves They advertise 100% uptime - impossible after the fact new hold backs(INODES) I told them and will say it again. If they were the only way onto the internet, I would just not be on the internet. I have proven them wrong on every side.
2 current complaints to Icann pending now. There will be more at the current rate. I have removed several name accounts, all of my own hosting. Will remove 27 more over the next 248 days as they get close to expiring. They were told in time to save and obviously preferred to keep with their crap. I am very happy where I went and almost everything I asked for or had to fight for at namecheap was willingly taken care of or already done when I got there. domain names are less, space is more, every thing is more except less price."
"Staff very politely working on resolving my email issues and connection to gmail.

They will always keep my business for their support.

Pros: Helpful staff that is patient and fixed my issues connecting to gmail.

Cons: I was impatient."
"NameCheap has been one frustration after another for the year and a quarter that I’ve been a web hosting customer with them. Slow servers. Down time. Total crash of the server I was on and they hadn’t done backups for two days. They reverted to the old backup but that took a day to happen. Meanwhile all my email and web sites were down and I was loosing money. Then a few days later they disabled my account for excess CPU usage but the problem really stems from the whole issue with the server crash and the CPU usage needed to get everything back online and make new backups. They’re not at all helpful and delay things for five extra hours. There have been many problems and I’m not happy.

Pros: Cheap. But you get what you pay for I guess and with a name like NameCheap it’s worse.

Cons: Down time."
"Namecheap security rules are excessive and too demanding. It’s excessive security is causing more harm to clients than actual good:

First, when I signed up for name cheap, the namecheap suspended my account for no apparent reason. I went through two weeks of hassle to prove my identity just to make a transaction of $17.25. It is ridiculous. I would rather choose someone to steal $17.25 from me instead of going through all that process and frustration. Simply it’s not worth it. It comes a point where the investment in security becomes a greater burden than the risk of insecurity itself. I’m pretty sure namecheap surpassed that line, and I advised them to soften their rules and security aggressiveness for only 10%. The Namecheap will still maintain the positive image of security it has, but it will be less painful for it’s sincere clients.

Secondly, last days their sms verification system is broken, and the sms never arrived in my phone, and there was no option to call my phone. I spoke with one of their online agents, and they asked 1) address 2) phone number 3) paypal account 4) paypal transaction ID 5) account email 6) order ID. I was able to provide everything except order ID, because when they suspended my account you refunded the money to paypal account and never sent me the order id in my email. Afterwards I was forced to contact namecheap to ask them to send the order id and receipt to my email, and they said login to your account and you will find your order id under the billing info. But how can I login in my account without sms code working, and how can I remove two steps authentication without order ID, and I cant read order ID without login in my account? This is nuts. I was stuck in circle at this point. After trying many times for two days I had luck finally receiving the sms code, because all their support system was useless and frustrating.

I have two other accounts in FatCow and I never had any of these complications there, and you know why, because they DON’T have all this “nazi” security. I’m arguing here that moderate security is better than excessive security, and I would rather transfer my Namecheap domain to Fatcow, instead than transfering Fatcow domains to Namecheap.

Pros: Good user interface. Many features.

Cons: Their support is fast but not so helpful.

Excessive security that often complicate situations for no worthy reason."
We have used namecheap for two years now. They have been reliable and helpful and their chat support has been quick and helpful
"Great costumer service

Pros: Great Costumer service

Cons: Great costumer service"
"Support was amazing and very helpful. I’ve used them for several years, but I’m transferring away now because their website is completely unresponsive. Luckily, it wasn’t difficult at all and I had no trouble transferring from them.

Pros: Great support They don’t hold your domain hostage

Cons: Unresponsive website"
The absolute WORST customer service anywhere!!!
"they suspend my account. i dont know for what reason. i have opened ticket about 24 hours ago but you didn’t solved yet. open my account so that i can copy my files and move to another provider. you peoples have no idea about business.

this is not request its warning. open my account otherwise i will go to court. because my websites are down from 24 hours & i am in big loss."
"1st time I registered I had countless problems so cancelled within 14 days, refund OK. After I went to iPage where I encountered more problems & paid much more money. The 1 advantage of iPage they have telephone contact for cost of normal call. Then I decided to return to Namecheap to try again, OK for 8 months but s soon as I transferred another Domain into same account as an add-on recently I found the add-on functions but not original site! It has been out of action for 2 weeks, during this time I’ve spent half my life dealing with umpteen help people, all ask for repetitive information, screenshots etc. Eventually they offered 2 months free hosting, what’s the point if you can’t use the account? I’m seeking a new host now, any suggestions for a reasonable price? + PROS: Cheap & cheerful - CONS: HELP depends who you get, no continuity. For uploading problems I got replies from 4 different people, all asked the information/screenshots etc so downtime over 2 weeks."
"They run unpatched cPanel and don’t care about the published root exploits. DO NOT HOST HERE.

As of December 2016, they’re running v52. That means this entire list of vulnerabilities:

forums.cpanel.net/threads/cpanel-tsr-2016-0006-full-disclosure.585082/

… affects Namecheap’s servers.

DO NOT HOST HERE."
"Normally, I have have received good service from Namecheap. Virtually nothing to complain about. But just recently, one of my email addresses has been spoofed and no end of tinkering and changing security measures has stopped this. I also cannot received emails from Namecheap sent to another email address on my domain name. I have checked both email address and both are working normally otherwise.

There is something seriously wrong at Namecheap."
"I used Namecheap as a replacement for GoDaddy because they had special pricing over the holidays. Despite a fantastic price I am not happy with their recommendation to use canvas website builder. I tried to remove canvas so I can add other services but it does not work. I have tried to contact them, but it has been two weeks without a response.

I wish I had stayed at Godaddy as I could always get help fast. If you are unsure with what you are doing then I wouldn’t choose namecheap."
"We got this account thru a third party and it was managed by a partner who recently passed away.

We tried to get some help via a third party to manage the website, settings passwords and email, but they have been having a lot of problems with Namecheap support. Over 3 months of emails with Namecheap f (Tatyana Kozhushko-Customer Support), (Olya B-Risk Management), and (Nikita P - Risk Management) with requests for information regarding ownership. Every response takes weeks for them to deal with, and this has been going on since november 2016. This is terrible."
"The ultimate package is pretty good, and as a user of 8 months I can see myself staying with them. My website loads in udner 2 seconds, and while I have seen some downtime they didn’t last long.

The average reply for help on their live chat is less than a minute, and they were very helpful. The hosting is great, but it is their premium plan so don’t know much about the other plans."
"I am on the school board of a small school, and use this company for hosting. Their service is terrible. You cannot call anyone … no live support, even if you want to pay. We have had one minor issue, which is still not resolved after weeks and weeks. They keep sending vague requests for more information, and with each step, you have to wait days or weeks for the next response to them. Every email we receive starts with the statement “We are sorry for the delay in responding,” almost as though it’s auto text. This is the worst customer service I have seen with any company, of any kind. I personally believe no one should use this company."
Their customer service is awesome. I got help right away and my problem was solved.
"not sure why anyone would say their support is lacking, they have online support that literally gets you instant responses"
"A2 Hosting is a provider with excellent customer support and security. If these are your top priorities, then look no further. Read on as we weigh A2 Hosting's strengths against its weaknesses."
I had serious issues with Siteground and changing to A2 all my issues were resolved. A2 support and speed is excellent.
Dealing with A2 Hosting has been an absolute pleasure over the last couple of years. They integrate with the software that I use pretty easily and when I get confused they are available 24 hours a day and they even pick up the phone.
Unbelievable fast and efficient customer support
"Whenever we have a problem, we have received a very quick response but I can say a preventive answer from professionally organized team. this not only saved our time but infect we felt prestige!"
They go the extra mile and do not send a few words to tell what the problem is and let you figure out what they are talking about and what you have to do... they actually do the work to solve the problem and explain what has been done or make the suggestions when it is out of their hands.
"A2 Hosting is a solid provider and comes with many interesting features (e.g. backups and staging areas). However, the uptime should be a bit higher."
"They are a great company that let's you develop your technical skills and help the customers with a great solution, it was a remote job and they always help you get to your goals."
"Everyone on the marketing team was a pleasure to work with.
I looked forward to to each Monday!
We were always there to help each other achieve company goals and made a greatly efficient marketing team."
"OK, there was a problem and they explained it in English (not inside techie jargon). They responded quickly to an alarming situation with a ""cancelled"" domain. This is the best kind of customer support. Aiming the explanations to the customer. Not ""dumbing it down"". Using plain English to answer questions and fix problems. Be sure to ask for plain English if the language strays into too much tech jargon. This is a problem with every hosting service -- not just this one. Bloggers and small website managers, for example, should not have to spend time learning language they are only going to use with customer support. People who have small websites focus on content not the engine parts."
"Worst web host I've ever had in my 10+ years as a web developer. It's now May 7, 2019, and the server they are hosting my website on has been offline for 3 WEEKS. They haven't provided an update for over a week. They say there was a malware attack on their servers, and they're working on it. I get that, but how in the world are they this ill equipped to handle this scenario? There should have been multiple backups in separate isolated locations. Worst disaster recovery planning in history. The last thing I heard from them was that they might never be able to restore my site, and I'll have to rebuild the entire thing from scratch. This is insane. Stay far FAR away from A2 Hosting."
"As I write this, my service has gone down *again* since April 2019 - it's been less than 2 months without a major incident. It's become a rather disappointing turn of events with this vendor, and now I need to start the arduous task of finding another vendor. Long story short - host your ASP.NET site here at your own risk. Quality has taken a serious nose-dive. --- If you had asked me about A2 Hosting some 2 months ago, it would have been a glowing report. The interface was a little slow, but the response time of my site was good, and overall, it was a good value for the money. Then -some weeks ago, their Winders server structure went down. It *stayed down for almost 3 weeks*, with very little information coming from the vendor. They had made note of a malware attack, so I stuck it out. When the system eventually came back, and they had to restore from a month-old backup, I took that in stride, too. Today - the system is down *again*! Again, there's no initial response from the vendor, and my databases, emails and web sites are down. Last time, the down-time cost me as an independent contractor. I can overlook the first time it happened, but if this the new normal for A2, then I'm going to cut my losses and find another vendor. This is so beyond disappointing - I *really* liked this vendor. But I can't afford another 3 weeks of down-time."
"Customer of 7+ years here, all the recent reviews are right. A2 went downhill incredibly fast in 2018, they blamed it on their Black Friday sale which sold more plans than their support team could handle. Now when I join live support chat, sometimes I'm 30 in queue - ridiculous when it almost never used to be above 10. Tickets have gone 2 days without a response these days when it used to be less than an hour. And the support reps screwed up a number of times then I had to wait another long time for another response. Also we had major performance issues with them and they wouldn't give us any hints as to why the site was performing terribly (sometimes 80 second loads) on their $200/month server. Without any ""fixes"" on our end, we solved the issue by moving to Kinsta at $100/month and our site was lightning fast again. Their shared hosting is probably still fine, but if you are going to move your business here, I recommend against it until they sort out their support issues."
"We have thier Pinnacle Windows VPS and our webserver and Management interface has been unavailable for a 8 days and no response to service requests. We can not get access to our data. We are forced to abandon the service and rebuild our store an alternate provider to get our eCommerce site in operation even though we have a 2 year contract paid in advance. We have received no specific status, nor expectation when services and data will be restored. This review is to document my disgust for the lack of customer management, and apparent lack concern of customer's business by not providing them the information needed to survive in a timely manner."
"I am looking to leave A2 now. The first few years with them were very good. The last two years have been the worst experience in my 12 years of reseller hosting. I have been given a full year of credit by A2 because my clients sites have been down so often. I have lost clients and people's trust because of them. Your reputation is everything and when you work with A2 you have no control and they take days to get back to if you open a ticket, so do not even bother with that. I have been tracking every single time I have to call them now for the last year and I have to call at least 4-5 times a month and my average wait time on the phone is between 20-45 minutes. That is appalling. Then the people who work for them remotely cannot fix anything, so you get a ticket ""escalated"", which means a few days before your issue is solved, or you get a large copy and paste section from their help section emailed to you!! I know what I am doing. I never call them unless it is a server/hosting issue that I have no control over. I am moving all my clients back to Hostgator. Do not go to A2. Something has gone very wrong with them. The stress I have had with them the last two years has been horrible. I kept one set of clients on Hostgator all these years and guess what, not one site ever went down, and I have only had to call in twice in 5 years! That is the difference right there."
"My very recent experience with A2 corroborates what the more recent reviews say below. I am in the process of trying to transfer my sites to a different company due to problems I've had with Newtek, and I was on-hold for an extended period of time having to listen to irritating music, which OK, fine, isn't horrific, but then was routed to a nameless voice-mail box with no meaningful message going in, leaving me with the impression that A, the place is completely disorganized, and B, that I'd be lucky to hear from anyone and if I ever did that I'm sure I'd have been told that I need to speak with ""someone else"" since I was not told what to leave on the message. Needless to say, if that's how it's going to be BEFORE they get my money, I can only imagine what it'll be like afterwards, much as prior reviewers suggest. Was going to send an e-mail to the corporate office but finding their info quickly was like the search for the golden egg. No thanks! Onward! Too many others to choose from."
"Hosting fails a lot compared to other companies. I left a positive review last year and deleted it. The big problem is the site fails intermittently. When this happens I go to A2 hosting an most of the time it is down also. This happened last month again, I was running ads on Facebook to promote my business and A2 lost their hosting again, the night before the event! I am a web developer by trade and have been sticking clients on another hosting company with no problems at all. Zero! With the price increases and the spotty hosting I will be following the same pattern with my own sites in a few days. What ever is going wrong they need to get it fixed ASAP."
"2017-2018 was great, as my account was just billed for the next to years, 2019 has started out horribly. First, they throttled my shared Wordpress sites as one process hit their limit for one moment. I got a email from Google that my sites are not responsive. Without warning, I got throttled. It was two weeks before I noticed. When I removed the errant script, it took them a few days to remove the block. I don't mind them doing this if they give me a warning email so I can fix the problem and become aware of it. Had they done that, I'd have found the errant script within a few minutes. Today, they just deleted downloads at one site without warning. These are files that my customers are paying for a digital download. They say that any .zip file must be a backup and backups are deleted after 30 days. My file usage was at 77%, well within their limit for this account. I won't be doing business with them for new sites."
"I used to host a web application on A2 Hosting. I migrated off them because I had intermittent issues with outgoing email not working and when I contacted tech support about them I had the following experiences. 1. The tech support reps didn't take the time to read the ticket before responding. I would email them and their tech support rep would respond with something that 2 or 3 prior tech supports had already suggested. It got to the point where every time I contacted them I spent 5-10 minutes typing up every single thing which they had told me earlier in order to try to get new answers from them. 2. They blamed my code for the issue even after I did research on their server configuration and found that the issue which I was having is a known issue with the software packages that they use. 3. After I moved my code to one of their competitors without changing a single line of code everything started working perfectly and I haven't had a problem since then, other than getting their billing department to stop trying to charge my credit card for another year's worth of service. A separate incident with a different account, the shared server that the account was on was going up and down like a yo-yo for over a week. When I contacted tech support they didn't know what the problem was or how long it would take to resolve the problem. I asked to be moved to another server and their support department said no. Avoid them and go somewhere else if you have anything more complex than a simple web page. Their tech support department isn't capable of providing any support more advanced than telling you that whatever is wrong is on your end and their systems are working perfectly. They cost me hundreds of hours worth of unpaid time, meaning they cost me thousands of dollars out of my pocket because I would have been billing for that time otherwise. There are lot's of other hosting companies to pick from."
A2 Hosting is currently offering unlimited disk space and bandwidth. with guru 24/365 days support. Heres the problem; - A2 Host has established that anything larger than 3gigs is not allowed on their share hosting plans. Unlimited disk space but no more than 3gigs. Unlimited bandwidth but no more than an avg. amount which can as low as 56kbs. Please read the fine print A2 Hosting has hidden gotchas. Be careful with this company.
I have been with them for about a year and switched because of fast server claims. The server speeds are mediocre and the tech support is really slow. If I submit a claim it takes a good 6 hours to get a response and the chat times out by the time someone is available unless you keep working on A2 so it doesn't log you out--meaning the chat can take over an hour to get someone on to help you out.
"I was forced to make a hosting change several years back. My old host, similarly named to the University of Florida mascot, could not handle a simple request and it turned into a giant nightmare. After making the decision to ditch them, I settled on A2 Hosting after a significant amount of research. First thing I noticed was the speed of my existing website after the migration and DNS settings were complete. The 100% usage of SSD vs. mechanical drives had a huge impact on my sites load time. And since it's wordpress, any savings in time is huge. Also, they provide an in-house plugin that optimizes the wordpress installation and site performance. They also provide a cPanel interface, which makes it point and click simple to perform various tasks within your hosting account from creating email accounts, loading wordpress , WooCommerce, Drupal or Joomla scripts, to a whole bunch of metrics categories for analyzing website performance and reach. They even include FREE SSL (https vs http aka green padlock in search bar) certificates for your sites (may be dependent on the hosting package, but I am on the middle tier of their shared hosting.) In other words, I have their 2nd least expensive option available. The best thing about their support system is that I almost never have to use it. Since I have been with A2 (4 years in December), there have been only a couple of minor glitches that have been straightened out quickly. Please keep up the good work and don't change the company culture. It really is awesome."
"I had Blue Host but got out just in time to get my refund (worst support service - even worse than AT&T). I researched a few companies and found this company with a couple others were my final choice - I went with this one because of their good refund policy. Turns out I made a good choice. I've had to call support 3 times so far and every time I had someone on the phone within 2 minutes and guess what? They were helpful. I've been with them now for a couple weeks and everything is smooth so far. I will come back and update this in a few months but so far I'm very happy with this service. And for something like web hosting, good support is a major positive feature to have and so far these folks have been superb."
"I fired A2 Hosting for poor service after being a customer of theirs for 55 months. The reason I quit using A2. I received email notification on 10-16 that my email service was suspended due to a large volume of spam mail. Our company email account got hacked. I contacted A2 support when I received the notification. Support told me to clear out the fake emails, change the password, and they would remove the suspension. I did as they requested. I received confirmation they would lift the suspension. The next morning I didn't check my email because I was with a client. I get a call from my office tell me our email wasn't working. My office has multiple (6-8) phone and email conversations with the A2 support team. They promised they would resolve the problem. My office had to follow up numerous times because they weren't honoring their commitment to fix our problem. I arrived back in the office on the morning of Oct 18th to discover our emails were still not working. I called and left a voicemail for the CEO, Bryan Muthig. Bryan did not return my call, but our email was working within an hour. There is a lack of consistent service at A2 because of the lack of ownership on some of the people on the support team; due to lack of training or really don't care about the customer. I've had poor service experiences with their support team in the past, but I wasn't willing to take the time or make the investment to switch to another provider. This experience was the last straw. It cost my company time, money and the reputation with clients when we weren't responding promptly. I have fired A2 because of poor service"
"Their server has been down for over 2 hours because of a power loss. I thought they were a serious hosting company, but with no power backup generators, they are definitely not serious if you plan on hosting a website for your business. They are also ignoring requests for a compensation (partial refund) for the interruption."
"I have to say, I really have enjoyed using A2 Hosting or my needs. For business, I have a Managed Dedicated Server with them. It is fast, meets all my needs and then some, and their support is world class! The pricing is very competitive and I may just move my personal hosting to A2 as well."
"We had a series of migration-related issues which took about a week to sort out. All in all, A2 tech support has been great, and this server is much faster than the reseller account I had at BlueHost. I've found it best to call in off or early morning hours to avoid staying on hold a long time."
"They suddenly shut down our email sending ability - for ALL our domains and addresses. After opening a ticket we were told, that ONE of the email addresses was compromised and used to send spam. This is what we got after a couple of hours. Asked why they did suspend all accounts and why they did not provide any info prior they action. So, we are a victim and what does the a2 hosting ? Help us ? No way...Here is the answer from Jeffrey : ""The account was suspended as a whole because when working with sub-domains and addon domains, we do not have the ability to simply suspend individual portions of that account. We are forced to suspend the entire hosting account.."" They know exactly which account was affected and we immediately deleted it . End of story ? No way...Jeffrey refused restoring email accounts and said : 'Before we can lift the suspension from your account, please tell us what steps you will take to resolve this issue. We require a detailed plan of action describing how you intend to eliminate the current problem and how you plan to prevent future compromises.' So, it's been 36h now with no emails working, we are unable to send emails to our business partners, US customs...Deliveries delays, we are loosing the money, Jeffrey is still happy . The bottom line : this service is NOT for business customers. You can't get any help from them , you may be treated patronized instead. They are simply unprofessional and I strongly advice to stay away of such poor service."
"Dismal speeds even on their ""fast server"". Too slow for google they mark it down 30% for slow loading and their tech support is non existent be prepared to be on hold for an hour"

"I used them once, where in they had around a month of outage. This included support that wouldn't give anything about why not to anyone on twitter or directly. They then eventually admitted to me that they DO NOT backup any of the sites at least not on the package I was using."
"They have a team of responsible personnels, who constantly tries to resolve my hosting and non hosting related issues.
Thank you A2."
fantastic customer experience
"Reasonable pricing, excellent server performance, and powerful features - A2 check all the right boxes that are necessary for a stable and fast website. So yes, A2 Hosting is a good choice."
Very good support
"I don't even want to give 1 star. Why I cancelled it? Because I couldn't even login my Cpanel! Can you imagine that? I entered the right password! Because in another day, I could login. BUT then after some time, I couldn't visit my website AGAIN. 

So what's the problem? Their hosting is NOT reliable at all! My site was down very often. So I made up my mind to cancel it and will never use it again! 

After I cancelled, I asked for refund. Because they have a Anytime Money Back Gurantee policy. So they should send me refund. Guess what? They didn't send! They haven't sent me refund after 2 weeks. The company just makes me so angry!

I highly don't recommend it!"
"Great service and amazing, lightening fast support."
"Whenever we have a problem, we have received a very quick response but I can say a preventive answer from professionally organized team.  this not only saved our time but infect we felt prestige!"
"They've just had all my sites (hosted on the same server) down for several hours.  When customer service aaaaansweeeeereeeed their service call (VERY SLOWLY as usual), they acted as if they had no idea about the service outrage.  Lousy liars, crappy service, I wish I had never hired them in the first place.  Since I want RELIABLE service, I am going to fire A2Hosting.ca or A2hosting.com and will be searching to find a more reliable web host."
Good support. Very friendly staff. Asked them to do something and they did it without questioning it. Love it.
"Problem using FDP. Emailed the question and was running with the answer in well under an hour. Excellent service, well done!"
I had two customer service requests within a few hours of purchasing my new server from A2 and both their sales and technical support team responded in minutes. I'm very satisfied and look forward to working with them.
"I was previously with FastComet and decided to move over to A2 Hosting after reading the reviews about how fast their hosting is. It has just been over a week with them and I am completely disappointed with the experience. I signed up for their Drive hosting, and later learned that is it not enough to support my Wordpress ecommerce site. I decided to upgrade to Turbo per their suggestion, and the migration was done yesterday. All my websites went DOWN - reason: ""This is part of migration here we have to suspend old account to avoid data mismatch."" I have performed an upgrade before on FastComet and the entire process was quick, painless and with ZERO downtime. With FastComet, after submitting a ticket you can expect a reply in about 5-15 minutes - from my 3 years of hosting with them. With A2 Hosting, good luck with that. The ticket took almost 4 hours to get a reply. I am gutted that after performing a migration, their ""Guru"" staff does not check before handing websites over to customers. I am waiting to see if their speed is really worth a trade off for their poor support - if it's not, I'm going to request a refund and go back to FastComet."
"I joined A2Hosting 2 months ago because I saw reviews that they support developers.  However my experience has been extremely frustrating.  The support team do not read the problem, they just assume that you have not read the knowledge base and send you links to get rid of you.  They are very slow to respond and for each of my issues have had to send at least 3 emails.  Out of 3 issues only one was resolved.  I had to rely on other developers solutions who have experienced issues to find solutions.  Extremely disappointed and seriously thinking of ditching this hosting."
Quick efficient response on to how to properly move my website URL.
I have my company's email server setup with A2 Hosting for like 3 months now. Everything seems to be running so smoothly. I recommend a2 Hosting.
I am SO pleased that A2 was able to fix a weird database error that had taken down a wiki I run! Their support team was quicker and more helpful than any other hosting service I've used over some 20 years of running Websites. I must thank A2 for saving my bacon!
I've hosted 2 sites at A2 Hosting for the last few months and haven't had any issues.  The sites are fast and always up.  I had a couple of questions when I was first setting up the sites and responses to my inquires were fast and helpful.  The pricing is good and I would recommend A2 Hosting to anyone.

"Hosting is fast, everything works as advertised.
Anyway, the support is not so good because it takes too much time to answer and resolve issues.
I'm comparing their support with other similar hosting services were I have websites."
I don't know what's wrong there. Tech support is very bad. They taking too long time to fix an issue. Even they don't reply ticket. Very upset.
Hosting Service cancellation is very painful from A2 hosting. Don't go with this company. Very bad experience.
"We first bought shared hosting, after having HORRIBLY SLOW website speed with little traffic (100 clicks in 1 hour) and lots of talk with their support decided to pay extra for turbo boost as support claimed it will fix our website speed. Their support is a bunch of amateurs, even after paying more for turbo we got disaster service and uselles website because they didn't transfer website properly to a new server. As a result we have incredibly slow loading email which caused huge losses for our business, till now the issue is not resolved and we contact them multiple times [SUPPORT #XVT-993-48646] but obviously they don't care, HONEST WARNING-STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
Such a fast migration. Very helpful and gave much more information for me to understand the entire process and what to expect during each stage.
"Their reseller hosting is great except a simple thing: I don't know why they configure to block my IP address too often. Believe me, you will hate when entering captcha INSIDE A CPANEL UI 10 times per day. Their rules also work with wp-admin/, so if you try to edit some Custom CSS in WordPress admin interface, you will be block sometimes. I contact them, and the reason is always about SSH failing connection, while I'm on a web interface, trying to edit a few pages in my WordPress. Can they explain why do they blocked me on cPanel or on wp-admin, after I logged in?"

"A Hidden Gem with a Few Rough Edges
A2 Hosting is much better than your average host, offering very affordable, unlimited hosting.
When reading through A2’s website, it seems that some features are being somewhat oversold. The company should just let its hosting do the talking: the service itself is way above average.
The simplified cPanel integration makes managing your hosting easier. Performance is superb and uptime is reliable. And while there is some room for improvement, A2’s customer support isn’t bad at all.

ir website being up and ready at all times - A2 is the company to go with. You can rely on A2 to support you and trust that they have your back whenever you need their support. You really don't have to be technical as they understand what you are saying and then they translate it into their terms. There is never a condescending remark or a sales pitch when you are in desperate need. I've never been asked to ""have my account reviewed"" while in a critical moment. It's all about resolving your problem. However, they will make recommendations that would best suit you - but it's never a sales pitch as they are just looking out for you. Also, I'm never on hold and asked to enter my account information, choose this option, then that option to finally wait to get to a ""Technical/Sales"" person. Why, because I don't have to. Rather than calling in I use their chat service. All I have to do is tell them who I am, what domain I need help with and the next words are - Hey Jeff when can I do for you! Now that's personalized service.When I first found A2 and decided to go with their service, I needed to have my site transferred from Go Daddy. I was introduced to James, who took care of everything for me overnight. I explained what I needed done and where I was coming from. With that information, James transferred my domain for me and moved my site software from Go Daddy. He completely installed my eCommerce site and honestly, it was seamless. I was amazed at how fast it happened and since then its been a happy marriage.Lastly, I would recommend A2 Hosting Company anyone who needs a reliable supportive hosting company and wants to get away from ""Stop Daddy"". Please feel free to contact me directly for references.

"There are many web hosts vying for your dollar, so it takes a special service to stand out from the crowded field and prove itself worthy of your money. Web host A2 does so thanks to its impressive packages, terrific uptime, and wonderful customer service. In fact, A2's high-quality WordPress plans propel the web host to the front of that WordPress hosting pack, despite some relatively high prices and zero Windows server options.Shared Web HostingIf you want to launch a site without spending a lot of money, shared hosting should be on your radar. Shared hosting places your site on a server with many other sites, so you share server resources and lower your overall hosting fee. It's a solid form of cheap web hosting, but it isn't particularly powerful. The main drawback is that the other sites that share your server can slow&mdash;or even take down&mdash;your site, if they crash badly or get a big traffic spike.A2 offers three tiers of Linux-based shared web hosting: Lite, Swift, and Turbo. Lite (starting at $7.99 per month) has unlimited storage and monthly data transfers, but you're limited to a single domain and just 25 email addresses. Swift (starting at $9.99 per month) builds on Lite by offering unlimited email addresses and domains. Turbo (starting at $18.99 per month) tops the other two by adding preconfigured site caching for faster load times.These are solid plans, but they're a step behind what's offered by HostGator  . The Editors' Choice for shared web hosting services boasts unlimited storage, monthly data transfers, and email addresses with each shared hosting plan. If you want to explore shared hosting, HostGator is the place to start.VPS Web HostingAs with its shared hosting plans, A2 offers multiple Linux-based virtual private server (VPS) packages. VPS hosting is like shared hosting in that multiple sites exist on the same server. The difference? VPS hosting offers more resources per site. There are far fewer sites on each server, and each is isolated from its server mates.A2's Unmanaged VPS (starting at $5.00 per month), a tier designed for experienced web site admins who have their own IT staff, has a scant, baseline 512MB of RAM, 2TB of monthly data transfers, and 20GB of storage. That said, if you go for the Elite tier, the RAM and storage totals increase to 1GB and 50GB, respectively. You aren't locked into those specs, however. A2 lets you spec out its Unmanaged offerings with up to 9TB of monthly data transfers, 32GB of RAM, and 250GB of storage.Managed VPS (starting at $49.99 per month) offers a base Power+ plan that boasts 4GB of RAM, 75GB of storage, 2TB of monthly data transfers. A2's top-tier Pinnacle+ plan has 8GB of storage, 150GB of storage, and 4TB of monthly data transfers. The plans come with HostGuard Management service, so you don't have to get your hands dirty with under-the-hood happenings. Additionally, the Core VPS (starting at $49.99 per month) has the same specs as Managed VPS, but it grants root access for complete website control. These managed plans, which see A2 handle the server care, don't allow you to increase the RAM, storage, or monthly data transfer totals.Hostwinds   tops those packages to remain the Editors' Choice for VPS hosting. It has you covered with 10 tiers of VPS hosting in its Budget VPS, Premium VPS, Windows VPS, SSD Windows VPS, and SSD Linux VPS offerings.For example, Tier 1 Premium VPS starts at just $13.50 per month (for 1GB of RAM, 50GB of disk space, unlimited monthly data transfers, and unlimited email), while Tier 10 scales up to $105 per month (for 15GB of RAM, 200GB of disk space, unlimited monthly data transfers, and unlimited email). The SSD Linux plan starts at $13.50 per month (for 1GB of RAM, 25GB of disk space, unlimited monthly data transfers, and unlimited email) and maxes out at $129 per month. For that, you get 18.5GB of RAM, 130GB of disk space, unlimited monthly data transfers, and unlimited email.One unusual VPS note: Hostwinds also has Minecraft (yes, as in the video game!) VPS server hosting. Like the standard VPS hosting, Minecraft hosting has a slider that lets you quickly select a pre-configured server. The entry-level tier ($8 per month) is designed for a maximum of 10 people; the high-end tier ($160 per month) can host a maximum of 350 people.Hostwinds also offers a choice of Linux- or Windows-based hosting, which is something that A2's VPS services lack. Hostwinds' flexible, powerful VPS plans outshine those of its rivals, making it tops in the category.Dedicated Web HostingDedicated servers are the most powerful web hosting offerings around, as your website shares zero server resources with other sites. If you expect a large amount of website traffic, you should spring for dedicated hosting.A2 has many Linux-powered dedicated server packages. The managed (starting at $169 per month), unmanaged (starting at $119 per month), and Core Flex (starting at $169 per month) servers all have at least two CPU cores, 8GB of RAM, 10TB of monthly data transfers, and two 500GB hard drives. They mainly differ in their abilities to let you obtain root access and use HostGuard Management.Those are attractive offerings, but the feature-packed AccuWeb is the Editors' Choice for dedicated web hosting. AccuWeb gives you a choice of customizable or prefab Linux- or Windows-based dedicated servers, starting at $105 per month for 8GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and 20TB of monthly data transfers. If you need more dedicated power, there's also the $385 per month plan that comes with 16GB of RAM (customizable up to 512GB), 250GB SSD, and 20TB of monthly data transfers.Cloud Web HostingCloud hosting is becoming increasingly common. It differs from traditional hosting in that it spreads resources across multiple servers, whereas traditional hosting pulls power from a single server. A2, like many other web hosts, offers multiple tiers of cloud hosting; unfortunately, they're limited to just the Linux operating system.A2's $5.00 per month Entry plan comes with 512MB RAM, 20GB of storage, and 2TB of monthly data transfers. The company's $10.00-per-month Mid plan ups the RAM and storage to 1GB of RAM and 30GB, respectively. The Elite plan ($15.00 per month) increases the storage to 50GB.A2's packages are good, but DreamHost   is the co-Editors' Choice for cloud hosting services. DreamHost's Linux-or-Windows-based packages start at $4.50 per month (for 512MB of RAM, 100GB of storage, and unlimited monthly data transfers) and top out at $48 per month (8GB of RAM, 100GB of storage, and unlimited monthly data transfers). If your website requires enterprise-class cloud hosting, 1&amp;1 Ionos   has you covered. The co-Editors' Choice has the specs and prorated plans that big businesses crave.WordPress Web HostingWordPress. It's a name  synonymous with web hosting, and a service that powers nearly 30 percent of the web. It's easy to see why: WordPress is easy to use, and has a rich WordPress theme and WordPress plug-in ecosystem to let you tweak the content management system as you see fit.If you want to go the WordPress route, A2 has you covered. Its three Linux-based WordPress hosting plans&mdash;Lite, Swift, and Turbo&mdash;are identical to the company's shared web hosting plans (A2 also offers more expensive managed plans that give your installation the white glove treatment). In fact, even the pricing is the same. The advantage of using A2's WordPress hosting plan is that the optimized environment enables faster page loading than its normal shared hosting package (the company claims that it's 6X faster than traditional hosting).A2's WordPress boasts unlimited storage and monthly data transfers at each tier. All that helps A2 topple previous winner TMDHosting, which experienced serious uptime issues in our most recent tests. A2 is our top pick for WordPress hosting.if you're new to WordPress, take a few minutes to get up to speed with our piece on how to get started with WordPress hosting.Reseller Web HostingIf you're looking to get into the web hosting business, but don't want to deal with infrastructure matters, check out A2's reseller hosting packages. The plans, starting at $19.99 per month, boast unlimited email and up to 200GB of storage and 2000GB of monthly data transfers. A2 offers a good mix of Linux-based servers, too, in the shared, dedicated, and VPS categories. In addition, A2 lets you apply your own branding to the servers you rent, and it supplies 24/7 tech support.That said, A2's reseller packages aren't quite as robust as Hostwinds' offerings. The category's Editors' Choice winner has a variety of excellent packages that are sure to please anyone thinking about getting into the reseller business.E-commerce and SecurityIf you plan to sell products, A2 has you covered with numerous e-commerce tools. You can use AbanteCart, PrestaShop, OpenCart, or another tool to construct an online store. All offer a one-click setup that lets you get started fairly easily. Magento, a common and popular e-commerce app, lets you easily drag and drop elements to create a store.Naturally, you'll need a Secure Socket Layer certificate to go along with that store. It encrypts the data between your shop and customers' browsers for safe online transactions. A2's SSLs start at $49.95 per year for a one-year certificate and 256-bit encryption.Excellent UptimeWebsite uptime is a vital element of web hosting. If your site goes down, clients or customers will be unable to find you or access your products or services. It's in your best interest to find a reliable web host that can keep your site up and running. Otherwise, customers may go elsewhere&mdash;and they might never come back.To evaluate reliability, I use a website-monitoring tool to track my test site's uptime over a two-week period. Every 15 minutes, the tool pings my website and sends me an email if it is unable to contact the site for at least 1 minute. The data reveal that A2 was incredibly stable during my testing. In fact, it didn't go down once! As I've learned from my uptime tests, a website is usually down for at least a few brief periods over the course of a month. Based on my testing, you can count on A2 to be a rock-solid foundation for your website.Excellent Customer ServiceIf you're ever in need of technical assistance, A2's aptly named Guru Crew is available to lend a helping hand. Available 24/7 via phone or live chat, the Guru Crew is one of the best customer support teams I've encountered in the web hosting space.I contacted the team on a weekday morning to learn which plans offer Windows-based hosting (none do!) and how to install WordPress. I waited just a few seconds before a Guru Crew member fielded my questions. A2's customer service squad ranks up there with GoDaddy's   as the best in the business.A2 offers an Anytime Money Back Guarantee that grants you a full refund if you cancel your account within a 30-day window. Sure, many web hosts offer that type of refund, but A2 one-ups them by offering a prorated refund if you decided to pack it up after 30 days.A Very Good Web HostA2 has nearly everything you'd expected from a quality web host, including terrific uptime and knowledgeable and friendly customer service representatives. The hosting packages are notable, too, especially its WordPress plans for which it is a new Editors' Choice.For more on getting started online, read our tips on how to create a website.

"This site is great
I have been doing my user interface on my website for several years

The hosting environment is secure and there have been no problems so far.
They are accountable"
"When looking for web hosting, many WordPress users go straight for the most popular web hosts – while others do meticulous research and end up at smaller, yet more focused providers. However, there's one host that seldom comes up in either of those two groups – so let's make amends with our A2 Hosting review for WordPress!

Despite not being well-known, A2 Hosting has made a bit of a name for itself thanks to its rapid speed and great support. However, when it comes to web hosts and their claims, it's usually best to take this type of information with a grain of salt, unless you've tested the solution for yourself.

With that in mind, we've rigorously tested A2 Hosting to see how it plays with WordPress, and whether its support and speeds are really all that. Let's get started on our A2 Hosting review for WordPress!
A2 Hosting review for WordPress - specific features
As a WordPress user, any web host you're considering should be held to a much higher standard. Given WordPress' massive popularity, hosts should offer specific features geared towards its users – A2 Hosting doesn't disappoint in this aspect:

 	Optimized WordPress installations: A2 Hosting offers optimized WordPress installations to maximize speed and security. This enables you to focus on growing your site without worrying about performance.
 	Fast loading sites: This provider's main claim to fame lies in its speeds. Faster loading sites lower your bounce rates and keep users happy, so they're definitely a good thing. We'll discuss performance in-depth later on, so keep reading.

So far, we're off to a decent start! Let's move on to see how A2 Hosting fares with its customer support.
Support options
We'd heard good things about A2 Hosting's customer support, so we were particularly excited about testing it first hand. Before diving in, we took a long look through their documentation. Their knowledge base includes over 40 WordPress-specific articles, including using Google Analytics and administering WordPress from the command line.

Moving on, we tested one of A2 Hosting's support agents using the live chat function (although they can also take emails and phone calls). After clicking on the Live Chat button, we waited a mere 20 seconds before having an agent assigned to us. We then proceeded to pepper them with a few basic questions:



The conversation went smoothly, and our agent gave us a couple of decent suggestions for basic WordPress plugins – which is exactly what we were looking for to gauge their attention to detail.
Performance
Raw performance is one of the main criteria you need to consider when choosing a web host. Here are the main features that A2 Hosting offers to improve user performance:

 	Solid State Drives (SDDs): All of their WordPress plans offer SSDs, which cuts down on loading speeds across the board.
 	Turbo feature: Some of their (more expensive) plans offer an exclusive Turbo feature, which claims to cut down on loading times enormously.

Aside from these features, A2 Hosting offers data centers in three locations:

 	Michigan.
 	Amsterdam.
 	Singapore.

However, with the above in mind, every web host claims to offer bleeding-edge speeds and technology – so you shouldn't take those claims at face value. Let's do some testing of our own and see how A2 Hosting performs.
Page speed tests with Pingdom
For this test, we used a bare-bones WordPress website without any customizations after setup. Then, we tested how quickly our site loaded using three different Pingdom servers in multiple locations to get more accurate results:

 	Melbourne: 2.24 seconds.
 	New York: 480 milliseconds.
 	Stockholm: 911 milliseconds.

We got off to a rough start with the Australian test, but recovered afterward. Overall, these are some decent results – so let's see if our server can hold up under stress!
Page speed tests with Load Impact
Load Impact enables us to test how any given site would perform under moderate amounts of stress. To do this, we configured it to simulate 25 concurrent users, added one by one over a five minute period. Here are the results:

 	Load generator: Ashburn, US.
 	Test server: Chicago, US.
 	Minimum response time: 230.83 milliseconds.
 	Maximum response time: 289.49 milliseconds.



We were hopeful after seeing the New York results for the past test, but we've got to admit – these response times were a shock! Loading a website in under 0.3 seconds is quite a feat, even more so for a website under load. It's fair to say that A2 Hosting delivers when it comes to speeds.
Pricing
A2 Hosting offers three shared hosting plans tailored towards WordPress users:

 	Lite (starting at $3.92 per month): This plan supports a single website and up to five databases, but offers both unlimited storage and bandwidth. It's perfect for users that don't require support for multiple sites.
 	Swift (starting at $4.90 per month): Supports unlimited sites and databases. This one also comes with unlimited storage and transfer caps. It's the perfect solution for power users with multiple websites.
 	Turbo (starting at $9.31 per month): The Turbo plan shares all the bells and whistles of its Swift counterpart, but also offers A2 Hosting's Turbo technology. It's meant for users that need to shave off every single millisecond of page loading speeds.

As you may remember from the previous section, A2 Hosting's websites load plenty fast – and that's without having access to their Turbo settings. We didn't get to test that feature personally, so at this moment, we would recommend sticking to either the Lite or Swift plans – depending on how many sites you need to host, of course.
Overall pros and cons
It's almost time for this A2 Hosting review for WordPress to come to an end, so let's take a minute to recap the good and the bad we've discovered so far.
Pros

 	Ridiculously fast speeds. This is one of the fastest web hosts we've seen, period.
 	A thorough knowledge base for WordPress users.
 	A friendly and fast-acting support team, who know their stuff when it comes to WordPress.
 	Free migration services.

Cons

 	Their prices are bit higher than some other entry-level shared hosting plans. Then again, you can get some good deals if you pay for longer periods in advance.

A2 Hosting review for WordPress: Conclusion
It's difficult to overstate how important picking the right web host is. After all, the wrong one could easily sink your site due to a lack of proper support and shoddy services. That being said, our A2 Hosting review for WordPress found none of these red flags here. In fact, their reasonable prices and high speeds make them an excellent choice for WordPress users!

Regardless of our review, it's always a good idea to compare and contrast hosts based on your own requirements. With that in mind, you may want to check out some of our past hosting reviews in case you want to shop around a bit before settling down:

So, their customer service is really fantastic, I can say this since I'm setting up sites for 16 years now and I tried several different hosting solutions; I can assure you that they are awesome and I strongly recommend you A2 for your sites.

George, the manager, called me and told me that it was a third-party complaint that had nothing to do with the server at all. He went on a stated that even an anon email or phone call complaint can get you booted. In fact, this wasn't even done on their servers. This feud with this person was real-life, over gmail.
A2hosting will remove you for any wrong doing you may do in your life, without court orders or law enforcement contacting them. This is not in the contract details.
Legally, a company only can remove you for breaching their service agreement, which does not include stuff happening in your life that they have no control or right to judge over.
A2hosting is a host I do Not recommend. They will not protect you so if you have speeding tickets, been to jail, or even competition out there that may falsely report you as a bad person or company ... then you will be prepared to lose your service.
FILES: Did I mention they'll terminate your site without letting you take your files? ""
I took my business to RELIABLESITE.NET! A2 had a 8gb ram 8core processor for $429/month. I have a 32gb ram 12 core 24 virtual core processor from ReliableSite for $309/month. I am extremely happy and they do not treat you like a criminal either.

Their support department has the fastest response time I've ever experienced with a hosting provider.  They always offer a clear and concise answer to my problem.  A2Hosting continues to amaze me with its focus on outstanding customer service.
"I have been using a2hosting for a few years by now, and I must say that it's been the best hosting for WordPress so far. Excellent cPanel as well.

The customer service people are very nice and friendly, always help you rather quickly, even now that we're having this coronavirus crisis.

Previously I used one.com hosting. They were far inferior to a2, and their customer service people were angry and hostile, on top of that they robbed me of one year of subscription payment for nothing, then just ignored me. 

Moving to A2 was a GREAT decision for me! It's not among the cheapest web hosting out there, but the overall quality is worth the price!"

Absolutely outstanding - I cannot praise them enough for their outstanding support, willingness to help and general knowledge and troubleshooting skills. A specific technician really went above and beyond to help me when most agents would have probably given up on me within 5 minutes and told me to look somewhere else."
"The A2 Hosting representative, Dale, was very helpful and professional. He listened attentively and gave me solid information on the steps to resolve the problem. A step up from the run around at my former hosting service, they were a bad parent!"
I migrated 50 domains to A2 about 2 years ago after trying a number of other big name hosts over the years. I have been very happy with A2 and have no plans to change providers again.

"I have used the ticket system numerous times, usually due to my own ignorance; however, your staff has always been prompt and courteous no matter what the situation. They have always resolved my issues in no time without criticism. Thank you so much for all you do."
Transition to A2 was seamless. Support requests are answered quickly and have the exact information I need to solve my question.
"I originally hosted with one.com in 2016 whom I was fine with but a 'friend', a freelancer with software development with 8+ years experience, was convinced he could give a greater service, setting up my website via LCN on his server. After 12 months, the freelancers service was appalling. Having done research on many hosting providers including GoDaddy, A2Hosting had the best reviews. Having been hosted by A2Hosting since 2018, they certainly care about their clients needs. Fast, helpful and a professional customer service. I would highly recommend!"

"Worst Hosting. Just stay away from them. If you have more sites on hosting shared plan for Wordpress they will throttle out your account and resources will be limited for your site like CPU, memory, etc. Your site will work very slow. 

And my customers always report problems to me and one of the problem is that your site will be down with: Error establishing database error or 503 Service Unavailable or some other error.

Their answer is like you need to install heartbeat plugins, cache plugins, same diy email all the time. They just copy paste previous email they sent you when you ask for fixing the problem.

Just go and see theirs status page. ( Search on google A2 Hosting Status ). They always have problems and downtime on their hosting. This will tell you everything.

Update (16.01.2020) I have to migrate all my sites to another hosting. Everything working perfectly now."
Last year A2hosting was in my  thoughts one of the two best hosting groups in the world for the quality of there support and general server prices and quality of running sites through but for whatever reason since 2020 the support always takes forever to reply back and always never helps .
Quick and informative service. Well done A2 team.  Very reliable
"Not as fast as they claim, was a customer was for a few months with a ping of more then 240ms. Once I moved my ping went to 23ms."
A2to replied to my email within one hour and sorted my problem. I was delighted.
"Support responses very fast and efficient.

The support is very friendly and really seeks to solve the problem we have.

I highly recommend A2 Hosting."
"Although I was reducing my services with A2 hosting due to changes in my needed web services at the time, I had several A2 support members (and Guru team members) who walked through the process of keeping my remaining services intact, helped me troubleshoot when things weren't working, and ultimately got my issues resolved. Once my business grows and need web services again, I will come back to A2 hosting."
"I used A2 Hosting for a client of mine who needed hosting for a Magento 2 website.

While I was happy with the hosting service, the problems started when I cancelled my account.

I raised a Support Ticket to cancel the account, and it was accepted and, to my knowledge, the account was cancelled and no payment was taken the month following cancellation.

Fast forward nearly six months and I discover that two payments were taken from my bank by A2 Hosting (both payments were two months apart, which was odd), and that my account hadn't been cancelled despite the hosting service being no longer available.

A2 Hosting claimed my account had been ""suspended"" and gave me instructions on how to cancel my account, despite the written instruction to cancel it.

The instructions they gave me didn't work because the account had the suspended status and could only be cancelled by their customer service team.

Unbelievably, I have had to raise yet another Support Ticket to inform them of this, and they simply reiterated the same instructions despite me telling them I cannot use that method, and, in any case, the written instruction to cancel the account is sufficient according to their Terms and Conditions.

I am still waiting for my account to be cancelled, and the refunds to be issued for the unauthorised payments they took, so I strongly advise people to be cautious with this company because every thing run smoothly up until the point I needed to cancel my account, and having unauthorised payments taken is unacceptable.

Buyer beware."

"Whatever you do, do not signup for a shared hosting plan. Just like most shared plans anywhere, they are sub par, and any potential savings you think you might have will give you countless headaches. I'm a WordPress developer and a few of my clients used a2 shared plans. I would build WordPress sites and just by simple developing they would throttle our account. Then when I would ask what's up, they would say I had to disable heartbeat and I might want to upgrade to a VPS. They they said, I might want to talk to an expert developer. For the most basic of someones needs, I can't recommend any of their products. And that goes for their reseller accounts as well. Big thumbs down."
"Very impressed with A2 Hosting's features and quick, informative support system. I've asked everything from basic questions to more advanced and they either answer back right away or in a couple hours. Love the features as a Reseller, I just wish they could offer unlimited bandwidth and storage space for my customers."
Their services are down from past 3 months and not given compensation and now charging for period which has already been paid by us.. Worst of the service... Chat never works.... Email support is pathetic as they feel whatever they do is correct in sensitive with customers... They want to customers to fail and runaway with the money...
We love working with A2Hosting. Their support is fast and very helpful for us who work in a fast paced environment. They suit us perfectly.
"Despicable customer support. You will wait 1-hour to solve the most basic problem. Then the customer support agent will ignore you, and respond with one short message that is a cookie-cutter bullsh*t solution (about 1 tiny message every 15 minutes until you give up cross off the window - only to hope that the next agent will be better – which they won't be). A f**king disaster of a company. Avoid at ALL costs."

"The support from A2 Hosting was excellent. All my queries were answered very well by the team. It was my first time purchasing a hosting service for my new website and I couldn't have done it without the support. The team was very... Read More
helpful in expediting my request when I asked them to. Overall I'm very satisfied with the support and the purchase. 5 stars!!!

A2 Hosting responded within an hour and added my new domain names to the SSL certificate. They solved my problem and have been great to work with. I recommend A2 Hosting to anyone who is using Wordpress.
"I was about to follow up, instead I decided to check again if it works.
And then Boom! It works.. I can log in again
Sometimes if they don't reply for a while after you created your Ticket,
It doesn't mean their not working on it, All we have to do is just sit back and take a sip
of a coffee while our concern is taking care of."
"Devin, Anna and David have all been a great help.  They replied to my questions more quickly than I could send them!  Thank you A2 Hosting."
"I would like to thank A2 technical support team for their effort in resolving issues, not just my issues but all customer issues. Their job is not an easy one, without them, A2 would not exist.
TOP RATE JOB A2!
Please let your technical support team know how important they are!
Thank you, Raymond Peterson."
"Does anyone of you had recently issues with hosting or had any financial loss due to A2 been hacked and hosting service been down for 3 months. As it looks A2 not even willing to pay the damages it caused.

So if you like to have some losses, go ahead and use there service as they are unreliable company, but MY ADVICE IS STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!"
I love quick technical support so I am optimistic in dealing with you
"I an running a managed VPS and it just works. 

What more Can you ask for."
"5 stars +     Many thanks to all of you who did a wonderful job and resolved my problem. I am able to edit my site with Front Page 2002 and shared WI_FI connection. Best Regards,  Peter Sobczak"
"Wonderful help, great price for a new business just starting out, thank you!"
"Jake goes above and beyond, what a refreshing relief after having such a bad experience at BlueHost. I look forward to working with people like Jake and Mike for years to come. Excellent job guys!"
"I contacted the support to find out if i'll buy a 36 monthly plan with discount, what will be the renewal price after 36 months, and will be there an discount?!
After almost 2 hours of mail discussion they didnt want to tell me is there a discount or not.
So i guess they have no discount for renewal, and you will pay full price with is not cheap at all!

Hope this will help others who has the same question!!"
good response
I really appreciate the security here at A2 Hosting
"A2 hosting is not reliable for online business and cause damage to your business reputation.
this was the biggest mistake I have done to choose a2 hosting 6 months ago. My dev team needed to do some small work before moving to AWS but a2 MYSQL has just crushed and they could not fix in 26 hours. STILL NOT FIXED WHEN I WRITE THIS REVIEW.
I lost hours waiting for support team just to hear sorry. It caused me lost of sale and extra wages to dev team, hug stresses and hundreds of phone calls from customers.
I wish if trust pilot had let me to upload some screenshots but I quote a2 agent on chat ""I have no precise time frame, unfortunately, but Tech will respond as soon as possible"" and 26 hours still waiting. If you selling online then it should tell you there no time frame how long your orders are not shipped, your customer emails not responded and it looks ignored, your sell is totally stopped, your website shows This site can’t be reached.
a2 might be ok for someone who is on shared wp with monthly fee of £2.29 and I have no idea if it does work good as I never used it. I have Managed VPS Hosting With Root Access and paying top price but surely their service is not worth more than £2.29."
Thank you For setting my new domain up and taking the time to instruct me how to access My dashboard via two ways.  I am always learning and improving.  Really appreciate it and recommend A2 Hosting to anyone.
"As a brand new user of A2 Hosting but a long time user with other vendors I can honestly say that I have absolutely no regrets. The support team took care of my site migration in record time and less than 12 hours after submitting the migration request my site was live even including DNS propagation.

I had used another top rated vendor for the previous nine years and they had migrated the site for me but I still had to make some configuration changes to get everything working correctly despite the fact that they had migrated from one of their own servers. With A2 Hosting everything just worked correctly after the migration with no configuration changes required. In addition the load times for the site have improved compared to the previous hosting provider so I am extremely happy with A2 Hosting and can recommend them to anybody considering purchasing hosting."
"I am new at A2 Hosting and so far its NOTHING!

I made at 8:00 a ticket that my sites are down, i get back:

We found MySQL has crashed and we are escalating this issue to our Advanced support team. We will follow up as soon as we have moved forward. Thank you for your patience.

Its now almost 14:00 and no news at all, still all is down. If you chat you get no help and they tell you there working on it. Come on working on it for 6 hours to restart MySQL?"
"Hi Guys, OK so I just moved all my 85 hosting accounts to A2 Hosting and so far the support has been Awesome!!, I am extremly happy with all the help during the migration to A2 Hosting, I had 5 websites that did not work properly after the migration to A2 and when i woke up in the morning you guys had fixed them all :-) THANK YOU!!"
Helped me quickly and effectively.
Thanks a lot of for support me. i happy about your'e customer care
"Everything excellent.
You are the best hosting company i ever used.
Go gratulation about your services.
I will continue using your services.
Continue the great job."
"Best service, Excellent!"
Solid service and excellent support. What else to say?
"Every once and a while you come across something so special, a complete game changer in the way of Customer Service and Hosting Support. Today was one of those amazing days.

Enter Brendon R. Support Specialist, a title that doesn't quite describe the sheer magnitude of magnificence that Brendon bought to the table on this request. Working with 5 techs across a few different companies to find a connection error on a site migration I was doing to my Reseller Hosting on A2. Brendon saw something none of us could see, a tweak that solved a 3 day mystery.

I'm sure theres some sort of shrine in the A2 Hosting Office with a smiling pic of Brendon!

Amazing Help and Support when needed. Thanks A2 Hosting, exceeding expectations!"
"We are a new customer in the A2 Hosting house and so far we are very pleased with the quality of support being provided.  The team is really knowledgeable about all aspects of the services required, from the migration of our WordPress site to the fine-tuning  of  all software required to optimize our site, they have proven to be the right choice for our business."
"I'm using service of A2 Hosting. I would like to use it in future and I recommend everyone to use A2 hosting too
Thanks a lot!"
"Excelent support, thank you alot for helping!"
"It's great, very fast & quick reply hosting"
Technical support. Very quick response and very informative.
"Excellent service, great value for money. Top quality hosting and customer support"
I recently contacted customer service about an issue I was having.  They responded quickly and provided the answer I needed.  I love their customer service.  It's the best customer service I have ever received from a hosting company.
done a great job. relocation of the US based services to the Dutch (Amsterdam) location was done fast and perfect.
Thank you very much for your timely help! A valid SSL certificate works correctly on my new site.
A2 with an A1 service. Completely satisfied. As a novice you guided me through the process smoothly.
My website crashed and I contacted A2 Hosting.  They were able to get my site back up and running the same day.  I am very happy!
"Have been with A2 Hosting for a couple of years. However, the service is no longer any good. First they had a service outage that meant I had no access to email accounts or websites for about 6 weeks. I received no explanation, no progress reports, no estimates of how long it would take to correct and no offers of compensation. Then, several weeks later, the catchall email functionality stopped working. When I raised a support incident, they responded by saying 'a catchall email address has not been configured for that domain'.

Not impressed. I would have given zero stairs if this system allowed."
"I spent several months without using A2 Hostings 
I am a recent and a ""poor"" user
So I didn't remember the way to work with.
Your help refreshes my memory
Thanks a lot to the team"
"A2 Hosting Tech Support are some of the best people I have ever worked with. The services are blazing fast and I am very happy that I use A2 Hosting for my business.

"Do not even visit there website! nothing goods is coming out of it, pay more and get better service"
Their customer service are very helpful and replay to your query very fast.
I worked a temporary assignment and had good communication and easily placement through the agency. I was placed quickly and found a job that fit my ideal hours and working schedule.
"Easy going manager, fun culture, flexible environment, very little micro managing but plenty of support if needed. Couldn't recommend more as an agency recruiter."
Atlantic Group feels very much like a family environment. Everyone helps each other succeed and the owners are always willing to try new and creative ways of doing business.
"One of the worst job assignments I’ve ever had, dealing with inconsistency, immature management, no direct contact, bullies, cliques, no where to sit for a break or lunch. Hiring animals, with no manners, respect for one another, or education."
This company is great to work for if you are looking to build flight time. However management in the flight department is below par and I would not recommend making a career at Atlantic.
"Flight ops manager was incompetent self proclaimed A & P who did not keep aircraft legal while I was there. Complaint about safety led to termination of at least a few different employees. If you value your life and certificates, stay far away from this company."
This is a staffing agency. They are in the numbers business. They throw bodies at jobs. You can and will be replaced at any time for any reason. If you are clran asa a whistle and can handle the 2 weeks of processing you can make big money for 6 weeks.
"I went on an interview for one job site and no follow up as to whether I was hired or not. I worked at another location that had a lot of temps in and out and no one was hired. The site did not train properly then lied and blamed me. The sites that seem to take on temps seem to be poorly organized, don't train well, lie, and express favoritism. I would not recommend going to a temp/staffing agency. I turned down full-time interviews because I was committed to working at the location. Never again."
"Overall great work culture, co-workers very supportive of one another. While working there, I learned a great deal about the recruiting process. The management and other higher employees were incredibly understanding and helpful in answering questions about the work given."
"Atlantic Group in Boston breaks the mold of a typical staffing firm.
There is a great office culture, team environment and you are given the opportunity to grow your career. I enjoy going to work every day in a tough industry"
"small shop, nothing much to see here. a typical day is wasting time in a saturated market at low markup ratios. not a place to go to unless they want to expand markets"
"work long hours, little quality of life. If you have a certain ""look"" you'll fit in, a lot of favoritism
I learned a lot, I'll give them that much. There were good days and a lot of stressful days. Too much work for one individual"
"The Atlantic Group always made me feel more like a partner rather than just another employee. Introduced me to people, fields, and opportunities. It allowed me to be myself while still representing the company and work ethic."
I am not providing a review. I do not want to provide information regarding a prior employer. My time was spent with the client and no time with the agency so there is very little data to offer
Get to travel and meet people and go to another job with them. Learning how to get along with others. work place is good. enjoyed working for this company.
"Pros - Good benefits, flexible work schedules, Productive workplace with numerous ""fun"" activities for employees throughout the year
Cons - Lack of formal communications from management - heavy and sometimes unrealistic workloads - too many chiefs and not enough workers"
this place is ok to work pay days suck they do not answer the phone when your trying to contact the office you leave messages and they do not return calls
"If you like recruiting this place is pretty cool. Super Chillax, Work Hard Party Hard, basically frat boy central."
I loved the company's unique experience because it was smaller and more intimate but had a very competitive drive to be as successful as a much bigger competitor.
"Arts, politics and culture are all good at the Atlantic."
Nothing but a bunch of opinionated based garbage being spouted by people who are very limited in knowledge of the topics they discuss.
"Very bad customer service to many other nice places to play, don't waste your time here"
"Location

10 / 10

If you’re a fan of remote and beautiful locations, this is hands-down the best option in Cape Town – located within Table Mountain National Park, with a private track that winds its way through indigenous fynbos to a pebble beach. The lodge, almost entirely hidden from view, comprises just 11 deceptively simple timber and glass cabins tucked under milkwood trees, the ocean their permanent lullaby. The city feels a million miles away but all the top tourist sites lie within a 20 to 45-minute drive away. Only caveat: the longer you stare at the mesmerising ocean and mountain views, the less you’ll feel like venturing out.

Style and Character

9 / 10

More luxurious beach house than hotel, the lodge rose phoenix-like from the ashes of the devastating 2015 fires and is now looking even better than before. With new milkwoods planted and clever landscaping, the bungalows still blend in perfectly with the dramatic sea-and-mountain environment, while décor is all about creating relaxing womb-like spaces in a new cool au naturel palette, using tactile materials that invite barefoot lounging.

Service and Facilities

9 / 10

A small dedicated team that selflessly served the local community – from repainting the fire station to offering cooking lessons at local schools – during the 10 months that the lodge was being rebuilt. Sincere, authentic, enthusiastic, they are all clearly very happy to be working here, and who can blame them. Facilities comprise a heated pool, plenty of viewing decks, mountain walks and excellent on-call therapists.

Rooms

9 / 10

Multi-talented owner-decorator Gaye Corbett made the most of the rebuild opportunity and produced 11 different suites. Each enjoys total privacy, with large sliding doors opening onto a deck just above the ocean, fireplaces and every conceivable room amenity. Rooms are named after islands – looking across the bay at the looming Sentinel you do indeed feel as if you are castaway in a mountainous archipelago.

Food and Drink

9 / 10

Exec chef Jeantelle Van Staden produces exceptional meals – just as well, as you really won’t want to leave. Dinners are included and wonderful. Guests are welcome to make menu suggestions (Prawns? Fillet?), state exact dietary restrictions, or give her free reign with a four-course set menu; either way, come prepared to feast.

Value for Money

7 / 10

Double suites from £371 (R8,520), including breakfast and dinner. Free Wi-Fi. Not exactly cheap, but given the exclusivity and cuisine standards, so worth it.

Access for guests with disabilities?

Yes.

Family-Friendly?

Children are welcome but with limited ‘romping’ space, this is not a destination I would recommend for a family with young or active children."

"{""We arrived late due to being 5 hours away. We were not told about the deposit when the room was booked, which no big deal but what if we didn’t have the money after we had already paid for the stay? We arrived as the police walked in as well because some guests of this hotel found a gun AND a machete on the beach out front of the hotel. Scary. But whatever. We got our room on the 4th floor, oceanfront, and We walked in to unmade beds, all the dirty linens and trash piled up and the toilet disgusting, so we requested a new room in which we were given a 1st floor oceanfront, that had pool chairs barricading our entire balcony so we couldn’t enjoy that either.

The desk clerk said there was laundry on 3rd floor. I guess he expected us to wash the towels ourselves? There was no towel rod or hook on door in the very small bathroom. The day I called to book the clerk was not very helpful. I had to call 3 times. Lots of banging and doors slamming in the evenings. Not many people on our floor so I guess it was maintenance making noises. Cody was nice and helped us carry our luggage up the stairs."",""Close to beach and I liked that I could bring my dog.""}"

Two times they have lost our check. Customer service is almost non existant and when you do get through to someone they are rude. Cannot pay online unless you have a checking account with them and I am not opening a checking account there! If they make this kind of mess with a mortgage just think how badly they can mess up a checking account!
"I used my debit card the first couple days of December 2019 > I didn't receive anything and the company will not respond back. I went to the bank to dispute it , it now has been a couple of weeks, I was told it would be back in my account in a couple days if not the same day. A couple weeks later nothing and now I check with the bank cant find it , the 800 number for the bank they cant find it . I have Well Fargo and Bank of America as well and when I have done this in the past , it was there the same day and done. This bank sucks . I will be closing this account if they dont fix this soon . Horrible customer service."
"I think I am paying way to much for this car, I want to but a new car, but I still owe $12,857 on my loan and the blue book value for the car is $6,500 so U’m stuck with a bad deal where I can't get another vehicle until this situation change."
The WORST Customer Service I have ever dealt with. I have been a member for nearly 5+ years & since it changed to Atlantic Union it's been nothing but Headaches! I will be closing my account as soon as I get a membership anywhere else!
The worst bank ever!!!! Our business account was with Access National Bank for well over 15 years and they were great! Since Atlantic took over in May of 2019 the service is the worst. This is not a bank for businesses and the worst part is that no one cares about your business.
"Don't waste your time at the Suffolk, VA Godwin blvd branch. I visited just before lunch on 8/16 and was the only customer in the branch. While asking the teller to speak with a banker about an equity line, the banker interrupted our conversation to advise the teller that she was going to lunch. The teller seemed embarrassed and asked that I return in an hour. I return after hour and 10 minutes and was told that the banker was still out but they would call her to see when she would be back. I score a zero on first impressions and very disappointed in the total lack of customer service."
"Written by a CPA: please save yourself hours of wasted time by avoiding any loans through Union Bank. Online access denied unless client goes into the bank to request it (we are in 2018, correct?) Have viewed statements where the loan breakdown is actually incorrect, which is unbelievable assuming reports like that should be automated and immune from human error. I have been on hold a total of 3 hours over 2 days just to confirm Union can break a payment into principal and interest because it was paid 1 day early and their system viewed it as an additional principal payment. The loan department would like 72 hours to see if they can ""resolve"" the issue but warned if another full payment is not made it will be late. These issues are widespread in our local CPA community."
"The branch in Winchester, VA is absolutely the most unprofessional bank I have ever dealt with. They made the mistake of doing a withdrawal from our Christmas Club last year and then inform3d us the 2nd withdrawal from that acct would automatically close the acct. Their mistake was the 2nd. They are very arrogant and rude. It is nothing to walk into the Amherst branch and see the managers and tellers playing on their phones with their feet kicked up on the desk. Today I went in and there were 2 tellers and the manager behind the counter. When I walked in another female teller was telling one of the teller behind the counter to come on...apparently it was play time for them. The manager looked at him and told him he wasn't going anywhere with an attitude that clearly showed he meant he was not going to wait on me. I told him what I needed to do and the entire time he and the manager were giving each other looks as though I was bothering them. They continued to make sideways expressions and chuckle and then look back at me. I don't have to bank with them and will soon prove so by closing all 4 of our accounts. They are childish and immature and customer service is by far a very low priority!! It's such a shame because before they moved they were amazing to bank with but now their service is absolutely disgusting."
"They are very bad about manipulating your transactions to try to charge you overdraft fees. So bad in fact that on one day, your account looks one way and the next day, it looks totally different by order of transactions, etc. You will think you are losing you mind and that you can't manage your own money but in reality, they are intentionally processing transactions in a strange order to be able to charge you NSF fees at $35 a pop. I know that a lot of banks are guilty of this but this is one of the worst!"
"I was looking for a bank that did not charge monthly rates for having a bank account. I then found this bank. I went to apply to open a checking account and everyone was very kind. I did have direct deposit and my money always arrived on time. They have an app to use on your smartphone as well. I am looking forward to the feature of taking pictures to deposit checks but it it not yet available. When the conversation of bank accounts come up, I always recommend this bank!"
"One word... Class! This hotel and staff exceeded my expectations further than I could ever imagine! Everything was top notch since we set foot in the door. The lady at the receptions desk was so kind an helpful! When we inquired about upgrading our room, she was able to help us get exactly what we wanted at an unbelievable rate! The room and view was gorgeous!!!! The suite was clean and very comfortable. That night they sent up a bottle of champagne up with a personalized card to our room for my boyfriends birthday. When we requested more towels and pillow, they didn't even bat an eye. We live in Fort Lauderdale and decided to stay here for a few nights and I can tell you that we will recommend all of our family and friends to stay here!!!! Thank you so much to the entire staff at The Atlantic for making us feel so special and welcome!!! Top notch!!!"
Nice place but Overcharged me on billing... Construction next door No hot water in room Will not return
"What an absolutely experience and company, Extremely extraordinary and quaint. still modern and elegance here. My favorite part was the dining experience with the guest and servers, Chefs make this place sparkle . The crowd it brings is warm sometimes snobby. Makes a great intimate setting too! The menu is mind blowing !"
"Came in for lunch with a heavy hangover from the night before. We were planning on going to Wild Thyme, but were told they only serve buffet style brunch on Sundays. So, we went up to the 5th floor Sky Bar for lunch instead. The view is beautiful on this floor and is the best part of the bar. Warm ocean breeze and spacious seating with We were looking for a hangover cure so we started with the buffalo wings flavored with tangy bbq; pretty good but not great. I ordered the fish tacos which were Mahi and my girlfriend ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps. My tacos didn't come with any kind of sauce or topping so they were dry but still well cooked. Both came with fries that were just the right amount of salt. I think it's designed more for hotel guests than locals. One helpful feature is the valet is free for the first 3 hours, which is perfect for coming for the restaurant."
"We discovered The Atlantic Hotel & Spa through the I Prefer Hotel program; and, we enjoyed our stay very much. The valet service was excellent, the people at the front desk were so very helpful, friendly and professional. The housekeeping staff personnel were great as well. We accidentally booked an ADA room, which had been neglected, so we had some maintenance issues that were addressed when we brought them to the attention of management. However, the Sky Bar was very loud, with music blasting well-past the promised 5:30 PM closing time. The drink prices are ridiculously high, so we only had our one, free, welcome drink. The bartender passed me over for a pushy younger patron, which was uncalled for, as I'd been waiting patiently while he served someone else. I guess if I had shoved $10 at him like the kid, that would have helped. The spa is very pleasant; and, the attendants are consummate professionals. I ""baked, boiled and steamed"" myself taking advantage of the sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. I met a very nice gentleman that was also staying at the hotel; and, we swapped ""war stories"" of our various knee injuries; and, I learned of a new treatment that I asked my doctor about and for which I may be a candidate. The spa needs some sprucing up and some updating. And, it's not coed, so the men are on one side and the women on another. According to my wife, the women's side is much more accommodating; as the men's is more of an afterthought. But, judging by the bookings, catering to women probably isn't a bad plan. For me, throwing a couple of hundred bucks in for a massage and facial just isn't my thing, so I thought the prices were steep. But, my wife said they are in line with other resorts; and, the fact that there was a constant stream of patrons coming into the spa/salon left me no doubt they make a success of it. I wish we could have enjoyed the pool more, as the beach didn't suit my wife's tastes. We did enjoy our balcony, our walk down to the beach; and, along the avenue; and, we enjoyed the close proximity to the sights we were determined to see on our trip. All-in, the parking, taxes, and resort fee substantially increased our cost of the 4-day stay, so be careful and figure in the total costs before booking. Would we come back? You bet - great location; well-maintained lobby and restaurant; comfortable beds, professional staff; and, proactive guest relations. We had a great time."
"This is my first review of a hotel. I stayed at this hotel 2 times in the past (the last time being in 2016) and was pleased with cleanliness and comfort. The third time was a disaster. After entering our room I noticed the overall deterioration right away. The sliding glass door looked dirty and smudged. The bathroom floor was filthy. I actually called to report this and Housekeeping did send someone to clean the bathroom. But there were still so many glaring issues. Everything looked completely worn out. Paint was peeling from a wall. It looked as if someone had used the bed posts for handcuffing MANY times. Hey, I'm not opposed to having fun hotel sex, but c'mon, you can't have the posts looking like that for new people checking in. The bed itself was HORRIBLE. Hard as a rock. The pillows were super small and way too squishy. The shower had mildew. The floor trim looked awful. I could keep going on and on. The WORST part was Valet hitting my boyfriend's back passenger rim on something while parking or retrieving our car. Of course, we can never have proof that they did in fact do this, but my guy is super OCD about his car and we noticed this right away. This was the final straw. We actually checked out a full day early and ate the cost. We told the front desk about the Valet incident. They apologized but did nothing to rectify the situation. They still charged us the overnight parking fee!"
This place has wonderful breakfast! Also you can park your car for $10 for the day and walk across the street to the beach! Valet takes your phone number and texts you and all You do is hit the text and car is waiting when you cross back over street from beach ! They also offer you a free water per person ! 5 star all the way !!!
"This was one of the best places for adults in Ft. Lauderdale beach. Nice pool, restaurant, room and more. Staff was extremely polite and helpful. Would definitely visit again. Valet was prompt and very courteous. Bat tenders were a riot. People staying at the hotel were nice. A little more upscale type of clients. Not much for kids, but I was there on an anniversary weekend. My teenagers stayed home ! Room was very comfy & clean. Pool area was kept clean. Great views from our room as well as most areas of the hotel. We would definitely return. Very good value. Honestly a 4-5 star hotel. Best bang for the buck we have ever had in Ft Lauderdale."
"My husband and I booked the Atlantic Hotel from October 12th through the 14th to celebrate our anniversary. I arrived before him and was hopeful check-in ran smoothly. Checking in wasn't an issue, but they do hold $140 PER NIGHT. I was taken aback by the hold, but the issue was resolved. I booked an oceanfront view. I was given room 604. The carpet in the room was dirty and lifting, the bathroom tub still had hair in it, the room didn't smell fresh, the oceanfront view isn't the best, and it just felt dreary. I was highly disappointed. The amount that you pay for a room, I expect great quality. I went downstairs and voiced my complaints to Analiza(manager on duty) and she was extremely apologetic. I was moved to a room that was updated, more spacious, and a great view. I had to call housekeeping to come and clean the floors. There was food on the floor from the previous guest. The refrigerator made noise allllll night and I had to report that. Maintenance arrived early to fix it. One thing that stood out the most was the staff. Everyone was amazing, but Analiza and Beverly stood out most. I wanted to love this place, but it is lacking in so many areas. The rooms need to be revamped, the carpets in the hallways need to be touched up, and it needs a fresher cleaner feeling. I usually do Marriott, but wanted to give them a chance. I probably wouldn't go back. The staff is the saving grace for this brand. I stayed in room 1011. Also...they charge 35 per night for parking. I think that's asinine being that resort fees are already added to your stay."
"It must be said that this hotel deserves its 4 star rating. As you will read from other reviews, it's a little beat up, perhaps not as pristine and sparkly as you'd expect. .. But what it lacks in glamor it more than makes up in customer service. ALEX went above and beyond when we let him know about a few -very minor- issues with our room. He immediately proceeded to accommodate us in every way he could think of. I was overcome with gratitude for his being so understanding, kind, and helpful. Absolutely generous with his time. His listening skills were also pretty impressive. Our room has a fabulous view, super quiet at night and a perfect (room service) breakfast in the morning. Come with an open mind, a little patience but know that if you need ANYTHING, they WILL go above and beyond trying to get it for you"
"This hotel is so beautiful and the staff treats you like family. My boyfriend proposed on the balcony of our room, which had a fantastic view of the ocean. The staff, especially Jerome, were extremely helpful with setting everything up and keeping it a secret from me. Not to mention they have a fantastic restaurant and gave us free dessert and champagne!"
"I stayed here with my boyfriend a while ago, and I will tell you this hotel is amazing. We flew in on a Thursday evening and were able to be upgraded for a small up charge to an unbelievable room... with two bathrooms and full kitchen. The view is divine. The smell that greets you when you enter is so welcoming, a subtle grapefruit. The staff was beyond accommodating and friendly. We had the couples massage and it was so good, if you can go!!!! The hotel's restaurant was so good. If you are planning a trip to this area, research this gem. Enjoy!"
"Review as a spa guest. Extremely disappointing experience: -My wife and I arrive for our massage and were told that no lockers are available. We are given plastic laundry bags in which to put our clothing. The plastic bags are not large enough to hold our shoes, and our clothing mysteriously comes out of the bags much more wrinkled than when they went in to the bags. -With no locker in which to store my valuables, I spend the next 3 hours walking through the spa with a bookbag on my back and carrying my shoes. -In the men's locker area, the staff member opens about 6 empty lockers. She says something about having lost the keys to those lockers. So while the front desk employee is correct that no lockers are available, it is not because the spa is particularly busy. -No flip flops or sandals are provided, or offered for purchase. -Our massage therapists are above average and friendly. -The men's spa area is filthy. Steel fixtures are rusted and there is mold on the shower curtains. Taking pictures in such an environment is usually a bad idea, so you'll have to take my word for it. I have been in better maintained YMCA locker rooms. -The poolside bar was average. We ordered chips and salsa and a margarita. Both were about what you'd get from Chilis. -The pool itself has a great view of the beach. The pool area was marginally clean. We stay there until the sun falls behind the hotel and the temperature starts to drop. Bottom line: not worth the money, unless you happen to be staying there. We were treated coolly by the staff - they were not unfriendly, but not exactly happy to see us either. The massages were above average, but the odd reception by the staff and lack of attention to details soured the whole experience. There are probably better beachside spas to try. Our local place - Lifestream, on US 1 and Oakland Park - is absolutely better, even taking the great view into account."
"Perfectly situated between Los Olas and Sunrise, the Atlantic is a great example as to why I prefer to stay in boutique hotels. We had a spacious efficiency with a balcony large enough to play cards and have drinks, which overlooked the pool and the ocean. A1A was hidden from sight and when our rooms sliding glass doors were shut, cars and street noise silent. We ventured here during many of the college spring breaks. I was a bit concerned, but this did not affect our stay. No rowdy kids spotted in the halls, pool or lobby. We spent our 6 days riding bikes (complimentary), sunning at the beach, (chairs, towels, umbrella complimentary and I also rented a city lounge chair 18.00), and walking or Ubering to dinners. The staff was always helpful. There was fresh fruit infused water and hot coffee in the lobby every morning (complimentary). House keeping was good and everyday, 2 bottles of water were left (complimentary). After dinner, each night we would have drinks on the hotel's covered veranda. Comfortable, teak sitting areas with hurricane lanterns anchored the ends and gave view to the gorgeous waters. My husband enjoyed the hotel's workout room and spa and I walked the strand daily. The beach and water were exceptionally clean and there were policemen patrolling everywhere. This is definitely not the old Lauderdale. No question, I would stay here again. I do agree with some of the reviews that the rooms could use some redecorating. I'm very picky regarding cleanliness and I saw fingerprints and smudges everywhere. The shower could use some new caulk or scrubbing. We did eat at the hotel's restaurant, Coastal, stunning view of the water, but the food average. Other than those minor issues, it was a perfect stay. FYI For some reason we had difficulty getting WI FI reception throughout Lauderdale. This was not the hotel's fault, but most likely Verizon's."
I have stayed at a lot of hotels and this is by far the worst. At 600 per night I expected at least a decent hotel. We were going to stay for a couple of nights and have a family of 4 so we booked a king suite. You would be better off with two doubles. I had to go down to the front desk to get sheets and pillows after waiting an hour as there were none in the room. This place is horrible.
We really enjoyed our stay here. All of the staff were super friendly and very attentive. Omar was great. He greeted us every day and I don't think he ever had a day off when we were there. And we were there a week! At first I thought it would not be a good place to stay simply because you have to walk across the street to go to the beach -but they have chairs and umbrellas that you can take with you! The pool area is nice with a view of the ocean and the spa is lovely too. Would love to go back.
"Carnival Cruise arrived on Sunday at 8 am and our flight back to L.A was scheduled for 8:30pm..so we had all day long before to take our flight. My husband got a Spa day pass for $30 per person, so we enjoyed the day at the beach. The Spa is beautiful! We got towels and chairs for the beach, and we leave our luggage in the hotel. It was a great idea to spent the day at the beach and come back to the spa and get ready for our flight. We will back to stay in this hotel for a couple of days in the future..they are located cross street of the beach!"
"We had an amazing time! Booked a spa day for my boyfriend for his Birthday. We had a couples massage and all day use of the hotels amenities. This place was awesome. The hotel itself is beautiful and very well decorated. The spa and amenities are located on the 5th floor. The staff were so nice and accommodating. Men and women have separate sides where they allow you to change, have access to private restrooms, a whirlpool, a steam room, a sauna and showers. After we checked in, they walked us back to our sections and had us change into robes then they escorted us into our couples suite where our massages commenced. The massages were great! The room was very spacious and set up nicely. We even had a private shower for after the massage. We went to the pool after our services and spent the day drinking and lounging. The servers at the pool were amazing. They will literally get you anything you need or want. We had a private couch that overlooked the ocean. It was so nice and relaxing. The view is beautiful and the pool area wasn't too busy. The drinks were good and we even shared some chicken tacos, which were very good. We were able to literally cross the street and be on the beach as well, which we took advantage of. It was such a nice time and a very relaxing and enjoyable Birthday for my love. I'm so glad I did this. We really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back here to actually stay the night and check out everything else this place has to offer. I highly recommend."
"This is a very nice location & the staff make it an amazing place that I will certainly look to stay in the future. We had a LONG day in Ft Lauderdale due to a very delayed flight. Bianca was incredibly helpful over the phone finding a room we could reserve for the day & made it available to us early on so that we didn't have to wait around d to check in. We were able to easily get there from the cruise port, and the check in process was simple & efficient. The room was a little beat up, but was clean, comfortable, huge, and had an AMAZING view of the ocean. We were able to use the facilities all day & the lunch in the hotels restaurant was very good & had GF options for my husband. Overall, we were incredibly satisfied and were very thankful to find this property!"
"I stopped in after the beach today for a cup of coffee to go. The staff were friendly and accommodating without hesitation. But the coffee, honestly, was terrible, and it was expensive, $4 plus tax for a 12 oz cup."
Outstanding course .The layout is very interesting and challenging. One of my top places to play in Palm Beach County
The course is in good shape and the greens are well maintained. I was paired with three women who hit from the red tees. They moved the ball along and maintain a good pace of play. We finished in 4 hours. Vey hot & humid day.
"I have really enjoyed playing this golf course, it is a nice layout and well maintained but I have learned the hard way that they have by far the stingiest rain check policy I have ever witnessed in all my years of golf. I recently played there and on the 4th hole it started raining. It rained hard off and on through the next 5 holes and was pretty soaked by the turn. I went into the pro shop and asked for a rain check and was told they wouldn’t allow it unless the superintendent “closed” the golf course. I decided to continue to play instead of forfeiting my greens fee and again on the 10th hole it started raining very hard for about 10 minutes with heavy wind soaking me. Once the rain stopped I tried to continue but was soaked head to toe and could not hold my clubs. The greens had puddles on them and the fairways were soaked to the extent that not only were my feet soaked but I had to move my ball to out of puddles. I eventually gave up and went home with wet clubs, clothes and shoes. This turned into a very unenjoyable experience that could have been handled by the pro shop at the turn. This was very disappointing that they force you to play in terrible conditions instead of allowing you to come back in more favorable conditions. Many golfers went home mad because they too were denied a rain check. I learned a valuable lesson which is do NOT play this golf course or even book a tee time if rain is even remotely forecast for that day. I hope the management will rethink their excessively stingy rain policy to show they actually care about their players, and that they want their golfers to have an enjoyable experience."
"First time playing the course, nice layout and good condition.
I will be back again as I thoroughly enjoyed the day.
I hear the food is amazing also!!
Thanks to the staff, it was great to get out and play again !"
"Starting from the pro shop you have to wear a mask upon entering the pro shop...totally agree.
Staff very friendly and welcoming, carts waiting for you and sanitized, hopefully?
Tee times are spread out and I love that!
Course in fairly good shape considering the drought conditions so maybe role it over to some green grass!
Good track of golf and usually always in good shape!"
"Even with being aerated recently, course was in good shape. Less than 4hr round which is a plus. As always staff was great"
"They opened the course after the Corona scare and after I made a confirmed TeeTime Thursday or Friday morning on Golfnow, I am angry because they told me Golfnow opened their tee times too early and all the early reservations made through Golfnow did not count. They said I should have been sent an email. Meanwhile, if you were wondering who “they” are, it is the golf pro at Atlantic National checking me in; he is the one telling me this because I am at the course and of course, I received no such email and Me and my three friends are told to leave. The Golfnow rep called them only to be told they couldn’t and wouldn’t do anything for us, it was not a hot deal so the rep told me the course should have excepted the reservation. The rep tried to give me some $40 coupon which was the only thing that was nice about the day. The golf pro said he had a couple earlier that it had happened to. So that is 6 people including our 4 that you refused the whole day until our 11:48 tee timer And you couldn’t squeeze us out?? Scum bag service and course for that. They didn’t offer another tee time in the future or attempt at saving the relationship. I was a member 2 years ago for the summer and they didn’t even mention that, the place is a joke and one of the Slowest golf courses in South Florida. Now I can’t play golf for the first time in 2 months because there are no tee times left. Thanks a lot I am going to tell everyone I know not to play there."
"Course had some bare spots and had some issue spots on a couple of greens, but otherwise it was a great round. The staff was great and had all aspects planned out from time to get there to how to leave tips. Very enjoyable course and the bad spots were from the work they did while shut down. Course will only get better."
"This golf course was relaxing yet challenging. The carts worked well, it was easy to do course management and it was fair. The conditions were very good and the staff was professional and friendly..
I highly recommend this course!"
"This was my third time playing this course in a month, and it has always been a really enjoyable experience!"
One of the best courses in the area..great layout. Challenging but very fair also. Good practice facilities and pleasant staff. It’s a must play.
Found the course in great shape and challenging . Nice layout. Conditions are very good the greens are very nice and roll well Staff is friendly and accommodating
"Always an interesting challenge, great staff, pace of play great, greens r a challenge but fair, definitely recommend it"
This course was fun to play and was the last in our 3 day tour of the area. I found the course to have some interesting holes and was very playable. Water did come in to play on more than a few holes but we all know you shouldn't be over there anyway. The greens were not huge and were in good condition although of the three courses we played they were the slowest of the three. I will say the tee boxes need some work. The bunkers are in good shape and strategically placed. Very nice amenities and practice area. All in all a very pleasant round of golf.

Same as most of the reviews. They locked my account right after they charged me on registration. Scammers!
Took my card information and right after registration my account is locked. Support is very unhelpful
So far I have nothing but praise for atlantic.net. Support is fast and curious. The website is easy to navigate and the server I requested was up and running within seconds. Not to mention the price was right. They're running a promo for the first year free on their 2.1Ghz VPS. :D

Then when you actually find out the issue it turns out you cannot sor it out because some weird error pops up, something like ""You cant delete your ECS2 Cluster Tak's VPC definition Load Balancer since it's used by your AWS45 Taks Definition PPI's CLI"". Now you have to spend the whole day looking for another piece of crap that was created automatically form another services but spread across their multiple subdomains and cluttered UI in order to figure out what's this and how to stop it. Their user interface without any common logic in mind, just a clutter of sub-services, subdomains and confusing sub-menus all over the place.
I strongly recommended to stay away from this mess, especially for newbies. Don't waste your time, just stick with Digital ocean, Linode or Google Cloud. Any of these 3 will be a godsend after a month of using AWS.

"Good overview
A lot of detail on the numerous optima and services on aws. A good foundation for their other white papers."
"Amazon Web Services (AWS) takes our Editors' Choice for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) for its sheer dominance in a number of areas. AWS (whose cost can be determined by contacting the company) will be the best option for most applications and businesses. It is the largest IaaS offering and one with the most comprehensive set of tools as well as a burgeoning list of third-party integrations. Competing platforms may handle some tasks better, but AWS continues to maintain market leadership. A mature product and service offering, AWS ensure most things work well and setup and management are intuitive and familiar. It also has an impressive level of service which smaller players will find hard to match.AWS has not rested on its laurels, it's improved in almost every area and its basic service levels rival the best the competition has to offer, including Google Cloud Platform   and IBM Cloud  .The vast array of services in AWS, which includes an even more vast collection of partners, lets you build exactly the cloud service you need. With its wide variety of other AWS cloud services&mdash;everything from cloud databases to e-commerce storefronts&mdash;you can build an end-to-end workload complete with management tools and custom-coded apps.AWS is also a prime example of exactly how key IaaS is becoming, in not only enterprise networks but in small to midsize business (SMB) installations as well. The AWS Cloud operates 54 Availability Zones within 18 geographic Regions, and one Local Region. The company has plans to add 12 more Availability Zones and four more Regions around the world. Keep in mind that an Availability Zone is a cluster of up to six data centers, with more being brought online constantly. In short, if you want to commit to a cloud service that's going to be here not just next year but for the next decade, then AWS is your choice.Core Features of AWSAWS offers the primary services you probably expect when you think of cloud service, including Compute, Storage &amp; Content Delivery, Databases, and Networking. But that's just the beginning. In 2016 AWS launched 1,012 new features and in 2017 it launched 1,430 new features. In addition to the basic four services, AWS offers Mobile, Developers Tools, Management Tools, IoT, security and enterprise apps. At a high level, you can control all of these with extensive admin controls accessible via a secure web client. Tools available here include identity management, auditing, encryption key creation/control/storage, monitoring and logging, and more.AWS has more options than anyone else in the cloud business. Need a database management system (DBMS)? Check out Amazon Aurora, a MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database service. If you need to put terabytes (TB) or even a petabyte (PB) of data into the cloud, then AMS Snowball, a briefcase-size appliance, can do the job. But if you really have a lot of data, there's AWS Snowmobile, an exabyte (EB)-scale data appliance that arrives in a 45-foot, ruggedized custom shipping container delivered by a tractor trailer.When you need to process all of that data, AWS offers Redshift, a data warehouse; and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), a Hadoop and Spark service. As you would expect when so much data is involved, there's machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) services you can use.Once you have gotten your head around a tractor trailer full of data, you can go back to the tiny data sets. AWS has the Internet of Things (IoT) covered now as well. AWS also offers more conventional cloud services than its competition. As you'd expect, there are virtual servers, containers, file systems, and block and archival storage. In short, there's nothing you can't do on a cloud that can't be done on AWS. It offers, by far, the widest range of both in-house and third-party software options and choices. If you ever get to the point where AWS can't handle your most complicated jobs, then you have reached a place in which you need to set up your own private cloud.Based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), AWS supports many Linux distributions as well as Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012, and 2016 on top of the Xen hypervisor. Amazon's cloud also supports Docker containers. And with 54 Availability Zones&mdash;each with up to six data centers in 18 geographic regions around the world&mdash;AWS is also a no brainer for multinational companies.Getting Set Up With AWSSetup in AWS has been significantly improved since the last time we looked at this service. The sheer volume of available services and options means that you'll need to study your options carefully to get exactly what you need. But while Amazon has necessarily delivered one of the more complex IaaS solutions on the market, the setup process has been well thought out and was surprisingly clear. Setting up a basic Amazon cloud is easy, and the available features are well considered.While the vastness of AWS provides a good market for consultants, unless you need something complex, you may be able to handle setup yourself. I had no trouble bringing up a Microsoft Windows Server 2016 and providing it with the required apps and security options. Some previous complexities within AWS, such as setting up Secure Shell (SSH) connections or using the Windows Remote Desktop have been automated to the point that there was never a problem. Setting up a Windows virtual server consists of specifying the parameters you need, including the number of processors, the amount of memory and the amount and type of storage. You can specify the network connections, your security settings and whether to include a database in the setup. Once you have clicked the right buttons or chosen the right choices from a drop-down menu, you fire it off and wait while it's built.There are pre-made images available from AWS, including images provided by other users on the AWS marketplace. Some of the choices are free, and some are not.Once you've set up your server and provisioned it, you can use Amazon's Remote Desktop to log in to it. Unlike some remote desktop utilities, the Amazon software provides a full-screen image that appears identical to one that might be on a local server.Even thought the test machine was running a 4K monitor that can relegate some screen images to a tiny window stuck in a corner of the screen, the AWS desktop did not do this.Perhaps even better, there was none of the strangeness that sometimes accompanies remote desktop use. Latency was not an issue. The house pointer acted normally. The Windows Server instance behaved exactly as if it were on a local machine&mdash;actually better since it also didn't have the weirdness created by the test facility's crappy kernel-based virtual macine (KVM).If you have more than one server that you're using at AWS, then the company will let you create a Virtual Private Cloud, which is a logical grouping of your virtual servers. Keep in mind that it's not a private cloud like you'd have in your data center or a co-location site, but it's what most organizations need if they're not processing highly sensitive or classified data.AWS has improved its documentation over the years, but the service has been made so intuitive that you may not need to refer to it much. Using the AWS Windows Server was essentially the same as administering a physical server in your own data center. While there are times when you'll need to use the command line or PowerShell, they're the same times that you'd use it whether the server was in the cloud or not.AWS PerformanceAWS performance was approximately on par with other cloud services I tested. For these tests, I used Geekbench 4 by Primate Labs, a cross-platform benchmarking app that's designed to treat all platforms the same, regardless of the operating system. This benchmark ran many integer, floating point, and memory tests. I ran the tests on a single vCPU and 2 gigabytes (GBs) of RAM running Microsoft Windows Server 2016. With this benchmark, the higher the score the better.The Geekbench 4 was 3021 for single core performance and 2862 for multi-core performance. These numbers were reasonably close to other virtual servers in this test with similar configurations. While Geekbench will test compute performance using GPUs, the instances we tested did not offer GPUs for these virtual servers.Service-Level AgreementsWhile throughput is an important part of overall IaaS-provider performance, it's only one half of the equation if you're putting mission-critical infrastructure in the cloud. The other half is the cloud provider's service-level agreement (SLA). Amazon's current SLA is roughly equivalent to those of other cloud providers.While AWS has a good track record if something does go badly wrong, don't expect to save your bacon with the SLA. AWS's default SLA, like all cloud SLAs, will not cover the cost to your business if the service goes down. It will just provide you with credit for use with AWS. What this means is that you will need to make arrangements for backup and recovery, and you'll probably need to have agreements for disaster recovery services when you need them.Pricing and ContractPricing on cloud services in general is a source of extreme complication. It's not that the pricing is intentionally hard to follow, but rather, that there are so many options, each individually priced, that you'll need to configure what you want to find out the price. Amazon has pricing calculators to help you, but those are complicated, too. This is a situation in which you may want to ask for help from Amazon's sales staff. That's one reason why a popular service for AWS cloud consultants is simply calculating an accurate price for a proposed cloud solution.While AWS has been aggressively lowering its prices recently, so have its competitors, including Google Cloud Platform and Rackspace  . However, the way AWS is set up, it's difficult to determine in advance what your cloud configuration is going to cost. As a starting point, the VM I ran the simple benchmark app in would cost about $14 per month. AWS also has spot pricing and reserved instances that can lower the bill by up to 90 percent and up to 75 percent, respectively, from on-demand pricing for EC2 images and other services that leverage EC2 (for example, Amazon EMR).The RightScale cloud calculator is no longer available, so we attempted to price an Amazon solution matching the previous standard configuration. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't offer anything closely resembling the standard configuration so, at our request, its staff priced out a configuration that was as close as possible. This included three on-demand micro instances: a web server, load balancer, and a hosting www site. These were supported by two on-demand micro web servers for peak demand and a small, reserved, one-year, light-utilization DR server.The 300GB S3 Standard storage for the database backup and a 4GB S3 Standard storage for the web server are no longer available in that form. There's also no longer a data transfer allowance; you're simply charged for what you use. For tech support, I went with the included ticket system. This simple web app would cost approximately $2,500 per year according to the pricing provided by Amazon. This is a significant reduction from the original pricing, but it's not the best pricing for this app.Amazon said that today's cloud technology has bypassed the type of setup we used previously and suggested another approach instead. For both a lower cost and higher resiliency, the company anticipates that customers will take advantage of EC2 Auto Scaling across multiple Availability Zones. EC2 Auto Scaling will bring both the ability to satisfy peak demand and to provide resiliency in the case of failure, according to Amazon.Overall, if you manage to put AWS together the way you want it, then you'll likely have a reasonably low price and decent performance. Plus, you will also have the most options and the greatest flexibility. For most organizations, AWS is your best choice. This is why it receives our Editors' Choice award in this IaaS solutions review roundup."

The site on this hosting is regularly unavailable. The administration explains the frequent falls of attacks on the server. Technical support is almost never available.
"Lack of support, unprofessional, frequent attacks, unavailable servers regularly, they deliver critical notifications by email.
No personal service at all. You must pay extra for support and they do not support you."
"Don't rely on Amazon Web Services for your server requirements. I have been locked out of my account as the two factor sign in does not work correctly.

They will not work with me to resolve this without paying for a solicitors letter confirming who I am. I am not willing to pay money for a letter like this."
"Amazon is the best not the easiest and not the cheapest.   Amazon  Web Service has more features than any other provider.   They regularly take open source projects, package them into products, and give them exciting names.   Plus, they develop their own products.   The number of features and options is awesome.  They also answer their trouble tickets.

All of this comes at a price, however.   Literally, AWS is the most, or one of the most, expensive places to obtain a virtual host.   The other kind of price is that many options, like excellent security, must be configured whether you want them or not.  That adds complexity.

To net it out, if your company has (or will soon have) a huge number of employees and complex requirements, then you should probably go with a huge provider like Amazon or Azure.  If your needs are limited to simple virtual hosting, you may want to consider Digital Ocean, Linode, Vultr, etc. because the price is lower and it is often much easier to configure."
"Not as good as it looks
We had an issue and after 2 weeks we figured it out... on our own. The worst support service we ever had."
"AWS offers the most services out of any cloud provider and they keep adding more and more services all the time. So there is a lot of investments and they support what they do. 

The issue I see with AWS is things get complex because you are not sure which service you should use and if you need support, then you are out of luck. 

Our issue is we could not find out the estimate of the cost or if we are provisioned properly. I was bugged when we could not get someone from AWS to help us out. But overall, they have the most services of all"
very difficult to get rid of their spam.
"AWS has extremely talented support and the products are great. No, it's not the easiest to figure out what is best for your needs and stuff like that, but creating a ticket will help you with that. I've always experienced great support with clear answers and further explanations if asked for. After my free tier EC2 instance expired, with the help of the well written articles I was able to downgrade my instance without any issues. 

5/5 from me!"
"Amazon is really a very good website with all kinds of goods on it. I bought an Apple Store recharge card on the previous two days, and I immediately sent it, which is convenient and fast, and speeds up my spending. ."
"Awesome service. I had the free tier for a year, and because it was restricted to only one instance, I had to pay 11$ for another instance for a month's usage. I was without doubt my flaw, because I didn't read the conditions thoroughly, but when contacted the service and told them that it was unintentionally to extend the free tier, I was refunded the 11$. Extraordinary service"
"AWS absorbed the original Cloud 9. Ever since Cloud 9 has not worked as did before, which is to say it is full of problems. I've had two issues pending with support since June 17, and they have not yet been resolved. I couldn't even download my project so that I could continue working locally and had to rebuild the entire thing.

I do not recommend this service if other options are available to you."
They are the best HIPPA compliant hosting service on the web.
"Never use their storage services includ. cloud. Do read carefully their contract: your data is theirs.

"We have ordered regularly from Amazon…
We have ordered regularly from Amazon over the past 6-7 years. When we needed help from Amazon with a shipment from ""LYRA Pets GMBH"", where the seller refused to refund despite the fact that the item was completely broken and unusable upon arrival, we turned to Amazon for help. 1. They refused to post our review of LYRA and the shipment, with no explanation at all. 2. They rejected our request for help with no explanation at all and no option to reply back. 3. We wrote another, rephrased review, of ""LYRA"" and the shipment and it was supposed to be posted within 48 hours but Amazon has simply ignored this review. We are disappointed and feeling belittled. When a company becomes an institution like Amazon has, it has privileges and responsibilities alike. This case reveals their utter arrogance."
"Excellent hosting company, I have used them before for my servers no issues."

"We have a security web site for uWatch Ltd and its been down for 4 days now.  You cant contact anyone at Amazon, you have to pay for a higher level of service to get them to do anything and then it still takes days to fix.

"While we did not encounter any issues with either customer support or uptime, we did notice our IP was flagged for malicious activity at basically every dns provider like CloudFlare.

Besides the flagged IPs we had no issues with amazon so far.
Pricing is good and uptime is solid."
Amazon web services and their Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud virtual servers has been farily reliable for my company. They are not cheap and you can find cheaper options. I will say they are fast though and you get what you pay for.
If it is free why do they ask for a credit card. People just accept that large companies lie them. This company is so evil I cannot believe it.
I liked Amazon until I decided to order a large order last summer.   The shipping came out to almost $40.00 so I contacted customer service and complained asking if there was a code to use because I thought it was very costly shipping.   They said they would waive the shipping fee for my order as a one time courtesy ~ just to e-mail them the order number so I went in and made this large order.  However after they processed the order and I sent them the code they e-mailed me and said someone was mistaken in telling me that I would get free shipping.  I was livid I sent them a copy of my e-mail regarding the free shipping so...obviously they knew I wasn&#039;t making this up about the  free shipping so I told them that they should waive it since I was told the shipping would be free and I ordered based on the e-mail I had stating this.  Otherwise I most likely would have ordered my items on line somewhere else.  They then said they would send it on to corporate and had the nerve to come back and give me a $7.00 credit on one of my items..gee thanks when my shipping was almost $40.00 and they lied to me I think to just get me to order something from them.   I know you can find almost anything on Amazon and I still order things from them occasionally if I can&#039;t find it elsewhere but usually I can.  For instance I ordered an Ipod from Target with 5% off and free shipping saving me almost 40.00 in all..so beware of Amazon unless you can&#039;t find it elsewhere you will get ripped on shipping for the most part.
"Amazon is really a very good website with all kinds of goods on it. I bought an Apple Store recharge card on the previous two days, and I immediately sent it, which is convenient and fast, and speeds up my spending."
If you want to scale up your website to be able to handle large volumes and you want a stable enviroment there really isn&#039;t anything better than amazon web services.
AWS is a great infrastructure to start with. I would recommend every business website to be using AWS
"AWS will often issue free infrastructure credits, somtimes $15,000 or $30,000, or even more, for up to 2 years. This can be very useful, so make sure you take advantage of this awesome service for startups!"

"This is a horrible company to host your site on. Here is what they did to my client. They offer these urls with the site. Then after you get your site built and you have all those links pointing to it and have a good ranking in the search engines, they will write you a letter and tell you you must change your URL to a new  one. They will NOT redirect your traffic to the new URL, instead they will put up a ad that says your Old URL is available along with an ad to buy a website from them.  They recently done this with the s5.com extension.  You can protest all you want to to these people they said they would not redirect the traffic to the new url (currently called mysite.com)  Stay away from these people they will ruin your business by taking over your URL and making it into a marking tool for their profit and all your hard work will be for nothing. THEY ARE SHYSTERS BEWARE!  Don&#039;t let them ruin your business like they did to our client.  There are plenty of good providers out there with a lot more to offer at a fraction of the cost. For example one with godaddy is currently offering unlimited number of sites for about $5.00 monthly (special). And then there is YOLA offering 25 sites for about $8 month.....don&#039;t get your business ruined by these crooks!!! Shop around there are plenty of good providers.  If you are still with these people your should move your site and put the redirects to the new location before they take over your url and wreck your business."

"****THE OWNER WILL BULLY YOU FOR GOOD REVIEWS****  please do not shop at this place if you think there is a chance that you may not be 100% satisfied.  I bought an 02 Explorer from this crook about 2 weeks ago. Right off the lot, the transmission was slipping and it was shifting pretty rough.  I called about this to set up an appointment with their mechanic.  Their ""Full service auto store"" is actually a 4x4 tent. So hopefully your car wont need fixed here during rainy season, because they can't work if its raining. I went in today for my APPOINTMENT only to be confronted about a 1 star review that I left! Seriously??  THEY WOULD NOT LOOK AT MY CAR BECAUSE OF MY 1 STAR REVIEW. They required that I change it before they would look at my car.  Of course upon hearing this, I did what any other normal human being would do and I told him to ""F"" off.  He is talking about putting myself in his shoes?  What about putting yourself in my shoes?  I bought a car from you that was advertised as being in ""like new"" condition.  Now, I understand that a car that is nearly 20 years old is going to have some wear and tear, but the back window was being held up by being duck taped to the ceiling. I would be scared to see a car that they considered to be in good or fair condition. they advertise having no dealer fee, but they have an ""electronic filing fee"" which, if you do your research, you will find costs them next to nothing. This is just an alias for a dealer fee.  The owners feelings got hurt by a 1 star review that i left and REFUSED to diagnose my car with issues that it had prior to me buying it. Their 2 yr warranty ""in writing"" obviously means nothing at all.  Then the owner will sit at his computer and watch the bad reviews roll in so he can immediately go to defend himself.  I have never had such a bad experience as this at ANY business I've ever been to. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place."
"ICANN sucks. 

This entity is supposed to manage the Domain Name System of the Internet. 
But was poorly though out and poorly implemented. 
Don't waste time your with them."
"Despite the protests from all over their partners, users and organisations. Despite 98.1% comments on their own public forum, they choose to remove caps from .ORG domains. Are you kidding me?"
"ICANN has annouced significant changes to a contract with Verisign which will let them increase .com domain prices by 7% each year for four years in a row, then a two year freeze, and then it will repeat. In 10 years prices could increase by 70% and ICANN will get an extra 20 million bucks. ICANN have also ignored previous comments on price caps where 3,500 comments were in support of price controls, and only 6 comments supported removing them, but they still removed them. ICANN are an absolutely disgusting company, and domain registration should not be privatised."
I have been with several hosting companies through the past 20 years in business and InMotion folks have a good thing going. I do pray things stay the way they are now !! Perfect.
"I have been using inmotionhosting for several years and it is one of the great and reliable hosting with sound supports. If you are new to the internet hosting and like to use multiple CMS sites with regular updates and backups, I will recommend it."

When you´ve done that a couple of times, of course you don´t buy it anymore and you want to talk to someone also, someone that knows something or can provide a solution, that´ll cost you another hour of waiting at least, once I could talk to another operator, he couldn´t do anything but he knew what he was talking about. He escalated to the team that really knows and they will send me an email, when the issue was fixed.
I received the email, customer support also contacted me apologising and all that but the issue hasn´t been resolved even though the technical team said all was working fine.
So I contacted them again, of course the first two hours wasted again (one waiting, one with the no clue guy) and I got the usual solution, call another day,
I said I am not leaving until get a solution, supervisor, another operator... something but I´m tired of wasting my time. They hang up on me, just like that

"Switched to InMotion after a TERRRIBLE experience with Netfirms, that caused site to be down for 5 days.  Hugely better customer service, (that&#039;s not in India) and very helpful.  Great features for the price too.  Highly recommend them."
"As a web developer since 1995 I have worked with dozens of hosting companies over the years. I found In Motion Hosting through a client who was using them for their website hosting. About two years ago I purchased a VPS package with them and after a few months, I began moving a number of client websites over to the new VPS. I currently have about 35 client and personal hosting accounts within the VPS (Virtual Private Server).

For most website developers, having a responsive support team for troubleshooting websites is a necessity. Getting support is very straight forward. For non critical issues, I will open a support ticket and typically these tickets are responded to within an hour or two. They also offer online chat for more immediate issues and you can also talk to a support team member by phone.

WHAT IS SUPPORT?
Support is not where the hosting provider tells me how to build a website or how to install specific software on the server or how to tweak website code.

Support is help configuring the server or assisting when a WordPress website suddenly has a white screen or won&#039;t connect to a database. Or it is help when a website is moved from another server and the website is not displaying correctly on the new server.

Support is also help bridging the gap between what I can do with my WHM (Web Host Manager) dashboard and more complex situations where I need help getting pointed in the right direction.

In my opinion, In Motion Hosting sets a good example of how great customer service, a can-do attitude, and a consistent follow-through on technical issues all go together to create a great customer experience.

HOSTING VALUE
Often web developers gravitate to the lowest cost hosting companies, which is fine in theory. Who doesn&#039;t want a lot for very little?  But my experience has shown that you get what you pay for.

Typically, low cost hosting services cut corners in order to provide extremely low cost hosting and often this means tech support suffers. I have learned this lesson the hard way.

I have also learned that my time is valuable, and hosting companies like In Motion Hosting who are responsive and helpful make my job easier and actually save me time. The last thing I need is for a technical issue to drag on for several days and for a client to have a problem with their website that drags on and on.

With In Motion Hosting I have the confidence that they are there to help me when I need help and they keep everything running smoothly.

I believe their pricing to be competitive and while they are not the least expensive, they are not the most expensive, and for me, they provide value.

Recently I added a second VPS and I will soon have another 10 or so websites moved over from my old hosting company.

Lastly, I am not being paid to offer this review."
Switched my business webhosting over from Hudson valley after my sites kept getting &quot;hacked&quot; hasn&#039;t happened a single time at inmotion. Very satisfied.
"I called to cut back my service, not for any reason except I&#039;m putting it on the back burner for now. The rep didn&#039;t try to talk me out of my choice and was incredibly courteous. When I decide to go back on line it will be with them."
"Customer service is in the U.S. Big +++. They speak clearly and stay with you until the problem is solved, or, at least, you know what to do. I have always found them to be clear, patient, and tenacious. (I am 88 years old.)"
I am new with inMotion hosting but until now I can say that they have good support and are helpful as usual.
"I&#039;ve been with inmotion hosting for over 7 years. They are a bit more pricey than other hosts, but you can&#039;t really put a price on quality.
Good support and are helpful as usual."
"I usually don&#039;t have to call tech support, but when I do I get a fast and knowledgeable response. And the last time, the issue was my fault and the tech fixed it for me since he was already in my account.
Don&#039;t be fooled by their reasonable price. My plan is both very affordable and comes with great support. Are there cheaper plans out there? Of course, but you get what you pay for. So pay for the best."
"I have used tech support on a number of occasions over the years (once when my web site was hacked, once to deal with a phishing problem, etc.).  Every single time, the tech support has been flawless - professional, helpful, fast, and efficient.  I&#039;ve always left with the answers I needed.  I usually call late at night and the service is just as good at off-hours as during the day.  The tech support at InMotionHosting is the best I can remember from any tech organization."
I&#039;ve been with InMotion Hosting for many years now and am more than happy with the service they provide.
"I have used a different hosting company previously and had nothing but problems. My site was down for a week for no reason, then stopped receiving e-mails from my contact page, then they doubled my fee without any notification. Finally I decided to find a new hosting company. I shopped around and felt very comfortable with Inmotion&#039;s customer service. Great futures with great price and outstanding customer service. They are professional, knowledgeable and polite. Much to my surprise they are located locally. It makes it much easier to talk to someone that actually speaks English and easy to reach. I highly recommend Inmotion."
"I&#039;ve been with InMotion for several years, and am amazed at the quality of service I receive. Their pricing structure is great, and any issues I have are consistently resolved without delay. I highly recommend them!"
A few years ago moved from Hostgator to InMotion and it was the difference a low-grade B&amp;B and a deluxe spa.   Great and patient customer service - especially if you are not very technical.  Migration of site went through without a problem.  Have been with them a couple of years now and have just upgraded my plan.
"When my Reseller (third-party supplier) dropped hosting services to my website with little to no notification, I was an emotional wreck. BUT InMotion Hosting, came through. Their customer service and support team walked me through every step. I had one bad experience with one staffer. The migration took a bit longer than the 24-72 hours stated and I had hoped but a lot shorter than what the &quot;mean&quot; staffer stated. My over all experience with InMotion Hosting has confirmed that I am in the right place for my domain/hosting needs and I will recommend them to anyone that needs the support! Raylan Smith, A+ Consulting &amp; Training Group"
"InMotion Hosting has hosted my history websites (HTML, about 600 pages total, no commerce) for many years, with good support (phone, US-based too).  I noticed that traffic was down, then I realized that instead of that little &quot;locked&quot; symbol browsers were saying &quot;Site not secure&quot;. It took a few calls to Tech Support to do it, but now at no added cost my &quot;blog level&quot; sites now display the &quot;lock&quot; and my pages are now https:  THANKS INMOTION. What a terrific team you have."
I&#039;ve been using InMotion Hosting for myself and my clients for more than 10 years and wouldn&#039;t go anywhere else.  Their 24-hour tech support is one of the main reasons.  I&#039;ve only used it a few times but they were important times and I always got someone who knew exactly how to solve my problem.  Another reason I stay is that their servers are fast and they are always upgrading their system.  They offer just about everything and at a price that is great.  This sounds like an ad but it&#039;s the truth.  I&#039;m a user and a web developer and very appreciative of a great company with integrity.
"If I were not to have the utmost faith in InMotion hosting, I would not be forking out hundreds of dollars each year in hosting fees. I believe that two key elements make them one of the top hosts I’ve encountered to date; Exceptional server performance and fantastic customer service."

I even had one guy email me with links to other sites for me to find the answers. I've never had this type of treatment with Go Daddy.I am hoping that they do not change and join the greed train.

"There are many places to find an InMotion VPS review, but our in-depth examination of one of our favorite hosts will give you all the info you need to decide which plan is right for you. From the start, InMotion Hosting has focused on two goals: thrill the customers with outstanding support and invest in incredibly stable and performant infrastructure. At the time, few customers could afford the jump from shared hosting to a dedicated server, essentially the only options available. By taking the reliability and power of a dedicated server and partitioning it among a handful of customers, InMotion became one of the first hosts to offer virtual private servers. As one of the pioneers of VPS hosting, there should be no surprise that InMotion remains one of our top picks. The company balances high-tech, high-performance architecture with some of the fastest, friendliest support technicians in the business.

With InMotion Hosting, managed services entail automatic backups, security patches, operating system updates, and two hours of service from a system administrator. Even though InMotion's virtual server plans are inherently managed by default, you can add extra services or time with system administrators on either an à la carte basis or as part of a monthly contract.

We are particularly fond of InMotion for including Launch Assist, or up to two hours of system administrator time to help get new customers started on their new VPS plan. The personal attention ensures the hosting environment will be perfectly configured and tuned to the customer's specific needs. Pricing: 4.8 / 5.0 Rating InMotion hosting plans reside in the perfect spot between user-friendly affordability and rich, developer-centric tools. Appealing to customers across the spectrum of hosting experience, the company's services are priced in line with others in the industry. At a very reasonable $22.99 per month, InMotion actually packs in more storage and bandwidth than most competitors. InMotion's prices are on par with those of competitors but doubles the amount of resources offered by a few other companies. On top of InMotion's affordable rates for virtual servers, the company offers one of the most generous money-back guarantees in the business. Customers who sign up for at least six months of shared, VPS, or reseller plans can receive a full refund (minus any domain registrations and fees for add-on services) within 90 days — three times longer than the average hosting company. Reliability and Support: 4.5 / 5.0 Rating Included free with all hosting packages, InMotion's support is available around the clock to answer customer questions through phone calls, emails, live chats, online tutorials, or an extensive knowledgebase with thousands of articles. The company delivers an above-average uptime guarantee across all hosting plans by relying on name-brand hardware, including Dell servers and routers from Brocade and Cisco. InMotion's team of support experts average four years of professional web hosting experience, and they aren't allowed to communicate with customers until they've completed a strenuous internal training regimen. Each support agent must register at least 160 hours of immersion with the company's LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl, Python, and PHP), email programs, and CentOS. InMotion Hosting’s High-Availability Infrastructure Sets the Tone Sunil and Todd never took on any external funding to grow InMotion Hosting, meaning the company has expanded since 2001 solely on the strengths of the company's infrastructure and support. The company hosts more than 300,000 domains and received more than 27,000 compliments from customers in 2016. As the company nears two decades of reliable hosting plans, customers can clearly see the benefits of aligning with a host that pays such attention to maintaining top-notch hardware and customer service. From its high-powered hardware to hands-on and attentive support, we strongly recommend InMotion Hosting for beginners, experienced developers, and businesses of all sizes."
"Aside from the fact that their performance could be higher, backups are paid separately and their backend is a bit old-fashioned looking, InMotion Hosting could be a great option for those looking for a basic and cheap hosting provider."
"Offering a wider range of services than most — including shared, dedicated, VPS, and even WordPress-specific plans — InMotion Hosting features a great combination of industry-leading hardware, always-there support, and mass scalability for all hosting needs.

InMotion Hosting has nice SSD drives on its shared plans, which give an added speed boost to your site. The company's customer service and reputation are excellent in the shared space, though InMotion tends to be a bit higher priced than some competitors. If a little extra speed is worth a few dollars more a month, then InMotion is a good choice for you.

In testing InMotion servers and account backends ourselves, there are a few things InMotion does that we especially appreciate. First and foremost, we like to see free and automated backups included with each plan, as data security is vitally important. The company also offers zero-downtime site transfers, which makes switching to InMotion or between its hosting plans a breeze. Finally, multiple datacenters and the ability to choose which will house your site appeals to speed freaks like us.

Regardless of your hosting needs, InMotion seems to have your bases covered. If you value great hardware and support, all at a reasonable price, we highly recommend InMotion as your next host.

I've been with InMotion for a few years now and every time I've had an issue I've gotten a fast response from the support team whether through chat or e-mail.
"I used hosting since last year. The service works very quickly, sites always work and doesn't lag. Technical support responds within 10 - 15 minutes. While I was a beginner, they helped me a lot."
I hjave been with InMotion Hosting for a few years now and have found their service to be second to none. I couldn't be happier with my experiences and reccomend them to anyone needing their type services. InMotion Hosting has acquired a customer for life!

"Pros: • Continue to be satisfied with this host and their support midway through our 2nd year with them.Cons: • Honestly, no complaints, so all I can say is free would be better:)"
I've had very good luck and service from inMotion. The times I've used their voice support and email support it was top notch. Chat help has not been as good but we got by. I will use them again.
"Pros: • I appreciate the response time and the ability to quickly get an understandable tech savvy support person to help.Cons: • Because they are so helpful and knowledgeable, I wish they had a greater scope of technical support, and could provide assistance in other areas as well."

le. They always announce when there will be maintenance on one portion and usually are up again before their estimates. They're not the least expensive hosts, but when our organization was searching for one, we weren't looking for the cheapest, but for reliable hosting and good support, and they've never let us down.They have a chat feature we tried to implement into our website, but my partner found it lacking on security in that a user could hack it and kick off the mod. Their checkers game has some typos in the documentation and sometimes it locks up during play, but I corrected a couple of typos and we feature it while suggesting players use Firefox since it seems to do better with that than Windows. These are both small things to us. No big deal.The main things work as they're supposed to, all the time. We've never had an issue with their billing. We've never thought about going with another host for an instant. We've recommended them to other individuals and organizations, and we proudly display their widget on our website myrainbowark.com

"If you're in search of a web host for either personal or professional websites, check out InMotion Hosting. This web hosting service boasts shared, dedicated, reseller, virtual private server (VPS), and WordPress hosting, as well as numerous free e-commerce tools. InMotion's lack of Windows servers and a few other minor issues prevent it from reaching the heights of DreamHost, HostGator, Hostwinds, and Liquid Web, PCMag's overall Editors' Choice winners for web hosting services, however.Shared Web HostingBuilding a website doesn't need to be an expensive endeavor. If you want to dabble in cheap web hosting, shared hosting is worth a look. With shared hosting, your site is in a roommate situation with many other sites on a single server. You split the server cost and the available resources. As you may have guessed, shared web hosting isn't very powerful. Sharing the resources means that if one site starts using a lot, there are fewer for the rest.InMotion offers three Linux-based shared web hosting plans. The most basic, Launch ($7.46 per month with an annual subscription), supports two websites and up to six domains. Power ($9.99 per month with an annual subscription) nets you six websites and up to 26 domains, while Pro ($15.99 per month with an annual subscription) offers unlimited websites and unlimited domains. All InMotion shared hosting plans include unlimited email, storage, and monthly data transfers, which is a nice touch.That said, HostGator gets the nod as PCMag Editors' Choice award winner for shared web hosting services. InMotion's rival also offers unlimited domains, email, storage, and monthly data transfers, and it adds the choice of Linux- or Windows-based servers. The Windows option is important for sites that have software that runs on an ASP.NET framework.VPS Web HostingIn terms of power, VPS hosting offers more pop than shared hosting. That's due to the fact that your site lives on a server with far fewer sites competing for resources than with shared hosting. Plus, the web hosts supply your site with a guaranteed minimum of resources. As a result, VPS hosting is more expensive than shared hosting, but it's a far more powerful and reliable system. You can think of VPS hosting as living in your own apartment; you'll have neighbors, but they aren't all up in your bandwidth to the same extent that shared hosting-stlye roommates can be.InMotion offers solid VPS web hosting that starts at $41.64 per month and tops out at $154 per month. You get respectable top-level specs, including 8GB of RAM, 6TB of monthly data transfers, and 260GB of storage. Unlimited email, domains, websites, and MySQL databases are included, too. InMotion has a good VPS offering, but it isn't as robust as the PCMag Editors' Choice for VPS hosting, Hostwinds.Hostwinds has stacked and flexible VPS offerings that start at $7.50 per month for 1GB of RAM, 25GB of disk space, unlimited monthly data transfers, and unlimited email. Its offerings scale up to $129 per month for 18.5GB of RAM, 130GB of disk space, unlimited monthly data transfers, and unlimited email.An Inmotion rep stated that the company's VPS plans double as its cloud hosting plans. In fact, there are no separate cloud hosting packages listed on InMotion's site. We recommend checking out DreamHost, a service that provides excellent, co-Editors' Choice award-winning cloud hosting for small businesses. If you need truly high-end cloud hosting that appeals to the enterprise market, 1&amp;1 Ionos  , the co-Editors' Choice, is the way to go.Dedicated Web HostingWith dedicated hosting, your website lives on a server all by itself and leverages the system's full power. In other words, you don't share your server with roommates&mdash;you have the whole house to yourself. As a result, dedicated hosting is an extremely powerful type of web hosting. It's one that you should look into if you expect your website to receive a large amount of traffic. Mission-critical sites that can't go down (or slow down) should be on dedicated servers.You can configure the company's Linux-based dedicated web servers (starting at $136 per month) with 3TB of storage, 15TB of monthly data transfers (which tops SiteGround's 10TB), and an impressive 64GB of RAM. Many of the web hosts I've tested offer just 16GB.Inmotion has solid dedicated web hosting plans, but AccuWeb  , the PCMag Editors' Choice for dedicated hosting, has better all-around packages. AccuWeb offers dedicated hosting packages (starting at $99) that can be outfitted with up to 2TB of storage and 512GB of RAM. They boast 50TB of monthly data transfers, too. You even get a choice of Linux- or Windows-based servers for extra flexibility.WordPress Web HostingWordPress is one of the top names in web hosting, as the service is the content management system for roughly 30 percent of the internet. If you're looking for WordPress hosting, InMotion offers solid packages. The web host's Linux-based, WordPress-optimized servers (starting at $8.99 per month, with an annual plan) come with the content management system pre-installed, and they offer free daily backups and automatic software updates. In a nice touch, InMotion will automatically update your third-party WordPress plug-ins. It also has the ability to bolster your WordPress installation with a custom-configured NGINX stack and an in-house caching system.The $8.99 per month WP-1000S plan offers 40GB of solid-state drive storage, roughly 20,000 visitors, the ability to host one website, and unlimited email and monthly data transfers. WP-2000S (starting at 12.99 per month) ups matters with an 80GD SSD drive, 50,000 visitors, and the ability to host two sites.That said, A2   reigns as the WordPress hosting champ. The Editors' Choice award-winning service boasts Linux-powered servers that offer unlimited storage and monthly data transfers at each tier. It also has several managed options for those who want their sites to receive the white glove treatment.Reseller Web HostingIf you're looking to get into the web hosting game, but you don't want to spin up your own servers or worry about providing bandwidth for them, check out InMotion's reseller packages. The three plans, starting at $27.99 per month, don't offer unlimited monthly data transfers and storage as Hostwinds' plans do, but you do get unlimited email, which is a nice touch.The entry-level R-1000S plan comes with 90GB of storage, 800GB of monthly data transfers, and unlimited cPanels. The mid-tier R-2000S plan ups the storage to 120GB, and the monthly data transfers to 1,200GB. R-3000S boasts 160GB of storage, and 1,600GB of monthly data transfers. InMotion provides 24/7 customer support, too, and it gives you a choice of Linux- or Windows-based servers, too. The plans are quite respectable, though they don't quite measure up with Hostwinds' robust, Editors' Choice award-winning offerings.Setting Up a Website With InMotionI chose the Launch plan for my testing. I am disappointed that my only option was to sign up for a full year. Like most web hosts, a discount is applied to the first term (for up to three years). InMotion discloses its renewal rates, so you don't get any surprises. There are no month-to-month options, unfortunately.I was initially a bit dubious when the confirmation page said that an account specialist would contact me by phone to complete the setup process; I couldn't log in until that happened. However, the call was prompt and helpful, and I wasn't pushed into making additional purchases. The representative asked a few questions about the type of website I wanted to build, and then emailed me the appropriate welcome materials.You access your general account settings from the Account Management Panel (AMP), but managing the website requires a separate cPanel login. I had some trouble finding and installing the basic site builder, which is, oddly enough, called the Premium Website Builder. Eventually, I contacted web chat support, but the person I chatted with referred me to email support. Thankfully, I got a quick response, and after I supplied my AMP password, the support team was able to set me up.The service's website builder requires yet another login and password, but building a website is an otherwise straightforward affair. You have three site types to choose from (site, blog, or photo gallery), you can select themes and colors, and you can pick the types of pages you'd like to include on your site. In addition to standard pages such as Contact Us and About Us, you can add special pages, such as Flash Intro and eShop. Next, you can add a map, poll, RSS reader, or script module into your pages. The Premium Website Builder doesn't produce particularly attractive pages, however; my site looked dated. Alternatively, you can use WordPress to create your site. That opens the door to many site-enhancing WordPress themes and WordPress plug-ins.E-Commerce and SecurityInmotion has many e-commerce options. You can add an eShop page using the Premium Web Builder and build a simple store. Payment options are limited, though. You can also download OpenCart or PrestaShop (both free) for a more robust store. I gave OpenCart a try; it offers a comprehensive dashboard for tracking customers and sales and multiple shipping and payment options. This beats other hosts like iPower and JustHost, which charge an extra monthly fee for e-commerce. Unfortunately, e-commerce isn't available with the basic Launch plan.InMotion offers several security features, including free remote backup services for accounts under 10GB in size. For WordPress sites, a free Sucuri Security plugin can be used to scan for malware and other security risks. McAfee spam and virus protection (starting at $1.39 per month) is also available for email accounts. You can purchase SSL certificates ($99.99 per year, with a $25 installation fee), which include a dedicated IP address.Rock-Solid UptimeUptime is an incredibly important aspect of the hosting experience. If your website is down, clients or customers will be unable to find you or access your products or services. That is a nightmare scenario. Thankfully, InMotion showed dependable uptime in my testing.I use a website monitoring tool to track my test sites' uptime over a 14-day period. Every 15 minutes, the tool pings my website and sends me an email if it is unable to contact the site for at least one minute. The data revealed that my InMotion site went down briefly during the testing period. Overall, InMotion is stable and dependable, but it's worth noting that some services, including A2  , didn't go down at all during testing.Customer ServiceI fired up InMotion's web chat on a weekday afternoon to learn about how shared hosting differed from VPS hosting. A representative appeared a few seconds later, and I got the information I needed.I later called InMotion's customer support squad to learn about reseller hosting. Someone quickly fielded my call and gently explained the differences in everyday language. I am very pleased with InMotion's customer service.InMotion has a very generous 90-day money-back guarantee that bests most other web hosts' refund policies. Dreamhost's 97-day money-back guarantee bests InMotion's offers by a week, however.A Worthy Web HostInMotion's lack of Windows servers and cloud hosting prevent it from entering our upper-echelon of top-rated web hosting services. Still, it's an extremely solid pick thanks to good uptime, numerous free add-ons, free e-commerce features, unlimited email at all levels, and a lengthy 90-day money back guarantee.

"I'm really impressed with the technical support provided by InMotion Hosting. I had some tech issues a couple of times and my site was down, but luckily the tech people from InMotion Hosting took the time to investigate and also to get my site back up and running. Yeah!"
The absolute WORST hosting company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with and I have been in the industry for 25 years. They DO NOT CARE about their customers or your customers and will take your site down with NO NOTICE and NO RESOLUTION. Wish I could give them zero stars.

"Tech Support, the biggest factor for deciding where to host your website and I've never experienced such great support as I've experienced with Inmotion Hosting.
I was with Rack-space and their fanatical support team for 17 years but the support folks at Inmotion hosting blew them away in matter of months putting all my fears to rest after moving my sites to a more economically reasonable hosting company.
The tech support is by far the best I've seen.

I can't say more, they're great!"
"I never write reviews for anything, but in the 15 months or so that I've been an InMotion Hosting customer, I've been so blown away by their customer service, that I wanted to scream it from the hilltops. I was alerted to InMotion from SideHustle School, and am so grateful for the tip. The rates are super-reasonable, which drew me in at the beginning, but it's been the customer service that has made me a customer for life. I've had around 5 calls with their team, and each time, the people I've spoken with have been helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and PATIENT. I'm hosting 2x sites with them now (brianscottk.com and poumyparty.com), and will definitely look to them for my next. If I could give a 6th star, I would."
"To be honest, I'm not an expert when it comes to working on cPanel or making other server level site modifications. I often find myself on the struggle bus unsure if I'm doing something that will have a negative effect on my site. InMotion support has helped me with every challenge I asked them and have helped me with several high priority issues. Thanks guys!"
"After a Wordpress upgrade, my site broke, and even restoring a back didn't fix the problem. I spoke with technical support, and they resolved the issue quickly and also explained why it happened. I am delighted with them as my hosting provider."
"I've had to use InMotion's tech support chat box often in the past couple of weeks. Even with them each working from home during this COVID-19 season, this support team has been stellar. Every person I've worked with patiently helped me get the answers I need."
"I feel so lucky to be an InMotion Hosting customer! I found them when I was living in California and they have continued to support me even while I’m living abroad! They offer that absolutely best support and service at the most reasonable prices! All of the support is USA based and that just feels rare these days. Absolutely every agent is kind, patient, knowledgeable and supportive. I continue to write 10 star reviews for them all! During the pandemic, InMotion has transitioned the agents to work from home and the support hasn’t wavered! I love that they are looking after their employees too! I highly recommend InMotion Hosting...seriously! They are the best. Thank you InMotion!!"
"We have been clients of InMotion Hosting for several years. We recently contracted an additional service, so at the moment all our clients are on the InMotion platform.
This has been one of the most correct decisions we have had, since the servers have been online permanently, supporting all our hosting and email accounts. And when we have asked for your support, they have been extremely kind and correct in their solutions."
"Worst support ever. you can even access your support ticket to update a ticket you opened,
Only chat  with ridiculous waiting times, and very slow responses from agents  for each input you provide it takes them 10-15 minutes just to process your inputs!"
"Terrible support, that matches terrible performance. Slow servers, unoptimized, garbage company. I've never in my life been so dissatisfied with a vendor. Never using these people again, and neither should you. It took me less time to move my business elsewhere than it was to solve an issue with them, for multiple sites. Just pathetic."
Great customer service.  I receive prompt replies 24/7 from a knowledgeable and technical engineer.  Bold Grid being integrated and included with their hosting is a HUGE plus for me.  That's about $60/year I don't have to spend extra for a subscription which comes included free with my hosting.
"Tech Support was patient and thorough

I chatted with Tech Support with a PHP question for my WP installation. I once again found InMotion's tech support chat to be excellent. My tech was patient and thorough, and answered all of my questions while I learned.

Awesome!"
"I switched to InMotion from a hosting service that was trying to force me to buy their very expensive  email program.  I have been happy with In Motion and now that they make more Technical help available 24 hrs a day,  it has been great.  Keep it up!"
"Reseller service is a joke, websites performance is ridiculous, as the support answers regarding it..do not use this service"
Pathetic excuse of a host. They always sucked and they're painfully slow (my other website's speed improved after ditching them) but what was the last straw is AVERAGE 6 HOURS OF DOWNTIME PER DAY 3 DAYS IN A ROW. They're a joke and pathetic excuse of a host. They're not even the cheapest host on the market but surely the least reliable by far.
"Migre de Hostgator a Inmotion con una promesa de mejor calidad de servicio basado en discos SSD y otras prestaciones. Lo que me encontré fue con una empresa que pone excusas e indica que no tienen problemas de velocidad de carga. Algunas websites en el hosting compartido demoran hasta 20 segundos en cargar a pesar de estar optimizadas y con imágenes de última generación (webp). Además de tener terribles servidores, limitaron las cuentas cPanel a tan solo 50, cuando yo contrate ilimitadas.

Lamentablemente me queda un año de contrato, inmediatamente buscaré migrar, no la recomiendo para nada. Compre el plan Reseller R-2000S. 


--

Migrate from Hostgator to Inmotion with a promise of better quality of service based on SSDs and other features. What I found was is a company that makes excuses and indicates that they do not have loading speed problems. Some websites in shared hosting take up to 20 seconds to load despite being optimized and with next-generation images (webp). In addition to having terrible servers, they limited cPanel accounts to just 50, when I hired unlimited.

Unfortunately I have one year left on my contract, I will immediately seek to migrate, I do not recommend it at all. Buy the Reseller R-2000S plan."
"Before moving to inmotion hosting I went over in detail how our account was setup at our current provider.  Nothing complicated 5 sites, all wordpress and emails on 2 domains with about 30 emails. All POPMAIL so don't even need to sync the accounts.  

I was told this word be handled by there migration team.  Once I signed up the sales person doesn't return any calls.  There phone lines don't work correctly so you can't reach the migration team.  

They didn't follow any of my instructions for the transfer.  At this point it would have been faster for me to setup the account myself.  Don't expect much support from there transfer team.

I have yet to see how good the hosting is.  But as far as support I would not recommend them.  All I would say is if you are expecting them to migrate from another host don't expect much support it's mostly self-service regardless of what they say before you start."
"Emails from my primary email accounts all disappeared if they were older than 9 months old. They could not explain why. Been using Inmotion for years, but something happened and they have no explanation.  Just that my emails have disappeared.  (One customer service agent suggested that they never really existed, which was ridiculous.  I can prove existence through my recipients over the years.)  Inmotion messed up and they will neither fix it or admit it.  A major problem and warning about their system.  Tech support used to be knowledgable, but that's gone downhill."

"Having worked for InMotion, I wouldn't recommend them as an employer OR as a hosting company. Their objective in technical support is not to actually help people, it's to get them off the phone. I ended up getting fired essentially for being too helpful. I just couldn't force myself to stop actually fixing things for people and just point them to the support articles to do it themselves and so my 'production' wasn't high enough. Because that's what counts, not customer satisfaction."
No room for advancement and the pay is not competitive. The environment and co-workers are great. I would recommend this job for people who are just starting out there careers.
Company offers great learning atmosphere. Regularly offers supplied lunches to workers. Management really care about employees. Co-workers can be rough on new people because they have high expectations. Company claims to be 100% for the customer yet will repremand employees for long contact times.
"This is a customer service job and it is pretty hard work. They have a high turn over rate because too many people get hired and can't handle the work. However if you can stick with it through the first couple of months it does get easier. The problem with the company is that they began increasing what they decided we should support without 1) any extra training and 2) actual support from anyone outside of the lower levels with the exception of very extreme situations. This made it very difficult to do your job. The second problem I had was there was a lack of transparency to how your job was reviewed. Sometimes you would get customer complaints and get no real feedback regarding how to fix the issue. Usually it was just something vague like ""try harder"". Other than those things Inmotion is a company that is pretty good at showing it actually cares for its employees."
The pay rate after training is not what I was hoping to make. Most call centers pay more even when there are survey incentives. The incentives do not reach expectations.
"This company will provide you with the proper tools necessary to become familiar with Linux web hosting. It will help to get your foot in the door. Otherwise, the pay is too low to stick around."
The company provides growth and okay pay. Fast paced and can be stressful at times. Would recommend this company to a friend. Great introductory jobs.
"I was at InMotion for about 5 years and while I really did enjoy the majority of the time I was there it became apparent towards the end of that time that there was only so much I was going to learn. The company is great and the people are great but the pay and benefits are sadly not quite up to par for people with a bit of experience and time in the industry. That being said, if you are looking for a place to jump into the tech world and get your feet wet, this is a great place to start."
"Great place to start an IT career. Lots of workload on the t1s and there is rigorous QA, but once you get into the swing of things everything is reasonably manageable. Enjoyed my time here."
If you are good at kissing and sucking you will move up plus you must be white in-order to well. Very raciest nothing but a bunch of devil worshipers that enjoy seeing other suffer.
"I enjoyed my time working at InMotion Hosting. While some days were more chaotic than others, overall, what I learned and the people are worked with were great, especially for an entry level job."
"Relaxed working environment, but very stagnant with very little actual opportunities for advancement despite what is advertised during the initial training period. You may ""advance"" to other roles, but the pay raise for a ""promotion"" is minimal if any at all. Management is inconsistent, and you can often find managers playing video games all day while chastising employees for being (no exaggeration) 1 to 2 minutes over their break time."
"The leadership expects employees to sacrifice their work/life balance to compensate for their poor business process management. Training is a very shallow broad spectrum shotgun blast of information before being put into production.
Once in production, what was taught in training does not really apply. Overtime is expected, if you wish to remain a part of the team. Leadership expects IMH to come first. However the for the amount of work and knowledge that's expected vs. the tools given to accomplish the tasks needed to meet expectations, it's the equivalent of slave labor.
On the one hand they say, put the customer first. In reality, its all about keeping the customer contacts to a minimum for maximum profit potential vs actually providing the level of service they publicly promote.
There are many great and talented people who sacrifice a lot to help others get up to speed. It's a shame this company has become the shell of their beginnings.
Feels more like they are getting into position to be acquired, at the expense of the people who have helped them stay in business."
"Was there for a few months, the training was cool, my trainers did everything they could to make sure we were successful. Once on the floor it was totally different. You’re expected to do a lot under a short amount of time, don’t mess up on the floor neither because then you’ll be treated like you’re incompetent by the and that you’re incapable of doing anything at all without them knowing. The management was sub-par, one of the higher ups could barely get through a sentence without saying “um like” every other word and everyone else just will just smile in your face and then do you dirty behind your back. My co-workers were cool and very helpful, but unless you were kissing up to the tier 2 reps or management you were pretty much left to your own devices.
So unless you like to suck up to people and walk on eggshells as far as work performance please don’t apply."
nasty environment rude employees unsanitary lack luster training good leads are routed certain sales reps .ladies in hr are the only bright spot. Do not apply
"In Motion asks for a lot from its employees, but they give a lot in return. The benefits are great, they have a huge recreation break room with games ,couches etc - a coffee bar area with coffee 24 hours a day, an actual kitchen area and cabinets stocked with snacks. once a week they bring in lunch for everyone, and there are also food trucks. The atmosphere is relaxed but professional, as long as you can meet your metrics you will be fine."
"Great hosting company with good support, easy to create websites and reasonable prices.
Kyle"
"Slow web sites, sometimes just stop working."
"InMotion Hosting is just plain awesome. They provide excellent service and have not let me down yet. Their customer support is GREAT! Another thing is that if you do not want speek with someone one on one, they have sooo many articles out there with other people’s questions and will most likely answer yours as well.

I’ve only needed to talk to an actual person once about a personal site error I was having and my representatives help me fix it right away. If you need a bang for your buck and reliable hosting provider, InMotion Hosting is the BEST way to go!!"
"Having tried various hosting providers I felt either I was paying too much or losing on the quality. At one point I was even planning to manage my own hosting on AWS.

After weeks of research I was finally able to narrow down my choices to a select few, I chose inmotion hosting and I am glad I decided to go with them.

I have had a few technical issues during the past 3 years but their support has been amazing and the resolution time is way better than what I have experience with other providers. I recommend IMH to all my friends."
"I found InMotion Hosting year ago via a blog post about WordPress…

I had troubles with my previous host who lowered my resources, although I was still paying the same price not to mention the bad support experience.

Eventually, I changed my host and moved over to InMotion. I got to admit, the first thing that amazed me is the intensive care they give to their customers, not to mention the great quality of their services .. Since I moved to InMotion, and my website never had a downtime. But what I really want to focus on here is the support – it’s probably the best experience I’ve had so far…"
"It’s very important to choose the right web hosting if you want to do a real long business. There is a chance that you may lose your data, money, and thus completely waste your time. A few years ago I had chosen Yahoo, but they didn’t offer the PHP version the developer I hired needed. I left and I spend a week trying to find the solution but to no avail. Then he recommended inMotion Hosting to me.

The uptime is GREAT, and last year inMotion had upgraded their HDD’s to solid state drives, which made my website a lot faster.

I love these guys, and they seem to have loved me too. Since last week I left them, since I no longer needed a website, but I might go back! (hence why the website doesn’t work anymore)"
I just want to say first that my website issues has been resolved promptly and it’s running again!!! I like to add that Edward H did a tremendous job and his customer service skills were super!! Even when English is not my primary language but he understood my issues and worked on them quickly and also offered some tips on the do’s and dont’s since I’m new at creating my own blogging site.
"When shopping for a reseller hosting provider over a year ago, I had one primary consideration – it *must* use SSD hardware. I initially signed up with A2 Hosting and was really pleased until I discovered there were certain packages that did not get compiled into their hosting package. I had to start again looking for another suitable host.

Doing some more research, I discovered InMotionHosting. They were offering an initial signup discount that was too good to ignore. It was almost by chance that I discovered one of their best selling points – they include a FREE license for WHMCS with their reseller plan. That made the value proposition impossible to resist.

Even after renewing my hosting plan at the “normal” renewal price, I feel like I’ve got a good deal for the amount of space and bandwidth in my package. Barring some competitor coming up with a better price, I can’t see myself switching any time soon."
"I never had many of the typical issues you face with worpress hosting on InMotion Hosting. For example you can install and send larger uploads out the gate (no 2MB bs), there is not much fiddling needed with PHP settings or any of that stuff that can make it hard to start a website. The help guides are detailed and largely up-to-date, but I used them less than I normally would, because most stuff simply works well as is and as it comes pre-configured.

The site speed is good. The servers are secure. The prices are fair. You might pay a little more than you do for bare bones elsewhere, but a full CPanel with ever increasing functions and very logical placement, attentive, technically solid customer support, secure fast servers and everything working out of the gate saves a lot of time and that makes up for more than the difference. I think those sorts of hosts are growing lately and a customer I can see why that is.

When you need support, the cues are short and the guys helping know their stuff and are quick to help (none of the typical e-mail replies, which tend to be rather absent of content). Instead you get knowledgable real people that are quick to help.

As a european customer I couldn’t use the Adword goodies, but that’s about the only trouble I ran into. I’d be happy to chose them again."
I consistently receive prompt and excellent service from InMotionHosting. I appreciate their work. They offer an excellent hosting package at a low price. I would recommend them above the services of comparable prices.
I had an issue with my WordPress site where I could not log unto the admin page and get to edit and work on my site. I tried for 2 days to resolve it on my own and reach frustration. I reached out to the Inmotion hosting helpdesk and they were able to fix it.in no time. I could not be more impress with the service and speed of their response. There is no question to me the SERVICE at Inmotion hosting is SUPERIOR to all others. One of the many reasons I do not plan to leave them and gladly been recommended them to my friends and family.
"I am not a tech-savvy person, so I wasn’t sure what to expect when I needed to put together a website for my small business. InMotion has been an invaluable resource. Any time I run into trouble, I can pick up the phone or start a quick chat. They email me with tips, information, or just to check in. I highly recommend it – for their product and their customer service."
"I switched my personal hosting to InMotion earlier this year. Switching is never fun, but with really good tech support it can be relatively painless. Fortunately, they’re terrific, and the whole experience was excellent. The site, even on a shared hosting plan, performs noticeably faster than it ever has, so I’ve been pleased.

But the test of a good company isn’t when things are going well. It’s when something goes wrong, and the InMotion team absolutely excel in that regard. On the couple of occasions I’ve run into problems (self-created in one case, a really obscure WordPress problem on another), the tech support folks have been great: courteous, bulldog-persistent and thoroughly in communication with me until the problem was resolved.

I’ve put a couple of clients up on InMotion, and they’re super-happy. Me too, because I don’t get host-generated problems and the back end is easy to navigate and secure.

Highly recommended."
"I just finished getting help from an InMotionhosting tech person, Felipe G. He was great. I was having an issue with an SSL Certificate that I had purchased and needed help making sure it would get installed properly. Felipe quickly figured out what I needed to have done and then installed the certificate, made sure it was working as it should… solving my SSL Certificate issue.

Thanks again Felipe G for your help."
"A couple months ago I had to make the switch from another hosting company, I was really happy with them but several issues prompted dumping them. Before jumping in I did some research in Google and other review sites, didn’t find this one tho, and was torn between SiteGround and Inmotion. After some chats with Pre-Sales of both companies decided to go with Inmotion and take advantage on some cool discounts they had for new accounts.

It’s not the cheapest but it’s not that expensive either. I have not had any significant issues, I have contacted support for some general questions and they have been really helpful every time. Just like you said, they might improve the site speed in general, but it’s not a deal breaker to me.

So far I’m really happy with their service and support, if I run into something major in the future will surely update this review."
"InMotion hosting is no doubt top class hosting. After a pathetic experience with GoDaddy, I moved to InMotion and it was one of the best decision I ever made in my life.

Highly recommended. A++++"
"My website is hosted on inmotion for more than 6 months. In my opinion, Inmotion is one of the best web hosts we can get under $10 per month.

I have monitored both the speed and uptime of my website consistently, speed remains between 400 ms and 500 ms and uptime was more than 99.98%.

I also talked to their support team frequently and found them to be supportive and intelligent.

My earlier experience with godaddy was very ordinary in terms of speed, uptime and support.

I clearly consider inmotion to be better than many famous web hosts like Godaddy, bluehost, hostgator, ipage etc."
"Worst Technical support. They have wasted 36 hours. My money making website did not work because of them for 36 hours. and they did not care about it.

Don”t buy inmostion hosting ever. end at last I cancel the account and ask them for the full refund."
I had my whole VPS deleted without giving a firm yes and no refund. The support was harder to reach with long wait times and not being able to come to the point.
"I am utterly at the end of my rope with the server outages on which my websites reside. I’ve chatted with technical support on numerous occasions, receiving a variety of bogus reasons as to why my sites are bouncing on and offline, now up to more than 10x/hr.

I have been forced to making a request to transfer my sites 100-3064657 when that should have been offered to me much sooner. I’m told that the server is a known offender and evidently has been overloaded or has a number of malicious websites on it or both.

The numerous outages are costing me time and money and I am not 100% Satisfied whatsoever.

The previously referenced ticket was created more than 48 hours ago and apparently didn’t get started until Friday. I contacted tech support last night for an update and only got a blanket response “…it’s being worked on”. I contact tech support again this morning and find that the ticket has been closed.

Now why would an incomplete ticket be closed? I am also being told that there is now no way to reference the status of my request as it was passed along to another group – How is any group of people supposed to be able to track and have any responsibility for issues that do not have an item identifier? That makes no sense to me at all.

This issue has me between a rock and a hard place – I can’t get current copies of my sites, so I can’t even transfer to another (hopefully more reliable) hosting service because the server won’t stay online long enough to get the data for even one of my sites!

As of the current time, between only four of my sites hosted at inmotion, outages have occurred more than 420 times in the past 24 hours."
"inMotion seems to have come to a HALT. I had installed an SSL certificate to one of my sites and it seems that they have no clue why one of my site is loading a different site. And the very same day, one of my site stopped showing up and the support guy has the gall to say that I am not hosting that site with them.

Now when I made it pretty clear that I am not pleased with them, their supervisor came up and told me that it will take time for propagation….Propagation of a website which was working in inMotion..As far as I know, the propagation is an issue if I changed the DNS configuration…They are thinking that people are fools."
"For the last 3 month uptime 100% and avr. rep time 240ms

My only complaint is they dont support “Let’s encrypt”.

So far I recommend"
"I signed up for this service because of good reviews. I was sold on redundancy, backup, speed, support…etc by their sales team.

All was well for a few months but then suddenly it all went wrong. There was a server outage, the promise of short downtime when I signed up quickly vanished. The promise of redundancy vanished as well.

Day 1… Apologies, no answers

Day 2… Apologies, no answers

Day 3… Threats of a legal intervention was met by canned replies that absolve responsibility. No answers

Day 4… more of the same, sites are still down, request for backup is met with vagueness of delivery

Day 5… Stronger requests for backup are requested again met with a response of a ticket creation and no timeframe of resolution.

Day 6… Strong request for backup is acknowledged and I was given an end of day delivery. I got the backups. No database. Turns out the database is corrupt.. there is no redundancy… there is only disbelief of trusting this company.

You have been warned… buyer beware."
"-since january 6, 2017 downtime 50 hours and counting

-in september 2016 (my site 72 hours down)

*customer service are a total waste of time, takes 80-90 min before you get an agent.

*absolutely no communication from this company when the servers are down

*no information why the servers are down

*no information about status and what they are effectively doing

*no countermeasers been taking (west coast servers are down often for a prolonged time)

*** i’m a very upset customer, been with inmotion hosting for the past 3 years but lately they have become very unreliable and they don’t value their customers.

(their chat agent will link you to their terms and service page during a server issue, stating that they are not obliged for a 100% uptime)

There’s no way they have a 99.98% uptime, that’s just manipulating numbers and paying off review sites."
My website with InMotion Hosting has been down for almost three days already. And this is the second time in something like a 5 month period. I’ve asked for a refund. I strongly recommend anyone to consider other options. I hope this will help other people to avoid mistakes.
We have started to move away from them. We started by moving away our eCommerce site. Now it has been nothing but trouble with them and they are only hosting our email. Their servers are down a lot. The advertised amount of time can in no way be true. Calling in or going to their chat take about 1 hour before you can get to someone who will just tell you there is nothing they can do. Very frustrating.
"As a previous employee i can tell you 90% of what imh claims is wrong. Servers are constantly going down. We have VPS nodes databases that went CORRUPT due to apower outage at our shitty west coast data center. It was our issue but we told people who lost their sites. Sorry but you should keep backups and gave them a free month of hosting.

Not to mention out ticket system is out of date. Theres no way for customers to view the tickets but it can take sometimes close to 2 days before you get taken care of or a 30 minute wait on our phone lines.

Thw out of scope here is so undefined if you need help with something not server or your wordpress specifically well have you see a dev even if it is a server issue. Ive had to actually argue with a higher tier to fix some server issues.

They also dont have enough people to handle the weekends. I ended up being the lone chatter a few times on certain days. Other than that theres only 3 people taking your chats on a sunday for a world wide support center.

They keep hiring people but the work sucks on the support floor so they keep leaving or getting fired."
"I’m not going to write a lengthy review. Let me just say that all my sites stopped working around sometime around noon Wednesday 12 2017. I waited for about 30 mins to see if the service comes back but it didn’t. So I called them and was told they were doing “unscheduled maintenance” and the issues usually get resolved within the hour.

At the 5 hour downtime mark I called again and was told they don’t have an ETA. I asked to speak with a supervisor who told me the same.

Today Friday (2 days later) service is still down. I called at 9:35am and was told again the same thing. I asked again to talk to a supervisor and was told he is busy. I was offered a callback and was assured that the supervisor (who goes by the name of “Jami O.”) will call back. Right now the sup it’s 5:56pm and nobody has returned my call.

My position is: I understand equipment fails. I understand that shared hosting will never be 100% up-time. What I don’t understand is how negligible and incompetent this company is. How is it possible that 2 days later (and counting) they can’t even provide me with an ETA.

I’ve been with inmotion hosting probably for more than 5 years but this has been hands down the worst hosting service experience I’ve had. Ever.

Not only are my 4 websites down but I lost 2 days of work because of this. I take responsibility for not backing up my work. However, the point is: Inmotion Hosting is an epic fail. Literally.

You have been warned."
"You absolutely should never use this company!

The server I have 2 client hosted on has been down for 3 days now with no ETA of when the server will be up again. They keeping telling me to check the status page but it has said the exact same thing for 36 hours. No ETA."
"I took hosting with InMotion after reading a review on the internet that it was the fastest hosting available…. How utterly misleading that was!!…..

Being new to WordPress having moved away from .NET hosting, I Initially needed space to develop several wordpress websites.

I took the hosting in November 2016, planning ahead, and then started to develop 1 of the websites but it was on my developers webspace, until the site was due to go live.

The site was finally uploaded and made live 3 weeks ago (April 2017) and to my EXTREME disappointment noticed that on the live site, the speed was absolutely terrible, taking up to 20 seconds to load the home page…. Would you wait 20 seconds? No neither would I !

So, at first opportunity AFTER going live with the first site I contacted your technical support to tell them of my concern….. his response although initially concerned, then went on to basically say, “If you’re not happy… go somewhere else!”

At which point, I said, I just want the best speeds for my website….. he apologised and suggested I go to MAXCDN to “speed up” my pages as they would cache them and make them quicker, which I did, but with very minor difference, as MAXCDN said the server was still slow….

But, then I got to thinking, “why am I having to do all this??….. to make a server that I read in a review was the fastest, now going to 3rd party companies within the first days of going live to speed the site up!” What a crazy set of affairs!

I asked for a refund because the hosting was not fit for purpose with 20 second loading times and not what I subscribed to.

I was told that I was out of my time for a refund, even though the website had only gone live in APRIL 2017, which InMotion would be able to see, as there was no traffic on the site. They have now refused to refund over and over again….

If InMotions hosting is not fit for purpose, they should give a full refund at whatever point"
"Wow, these guys are horrible. This review above must have been with some preferred account because so far I have had no good experience with these guys. Down for over 2 days, ftp constantly is down. I assume they are just constantly under attack because my root was hacked 2 times (yes with auto gen’ passwords only used on this site.) Overall they are a joke and I can’t recommend them less.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"I have a VPS and a reseller account at InMotion. At first the support was great, but now not so much. Sites go down regularly and the response is ‘we’re working on it, but don’t know when it’ll be fixed.’ Several times they have been down for days! They have also stopped my VPS server twice without any notice or reason given requiring a call to support to restart the server. Once this happened at night and I wasn’t monitoring the account. It was down for 18 hours before I knew it.

Definitely not recommended. Looking at moving all my sites elsewhere."
"This is my 3rd year with inmotionhosting. When I first using it , it was really fast and reliable. Lately for the past few months I am having multiple outages in a day. Sometimes up to 30 times a day. Their customer support is non existent and often gives a standard newbie answer, or completely choose not to answer despite that I am on pro plan. Reading all these feedback I am certain that I should switch out ASAP despite still having 1 full year on the plan. Man I thought that my site was having multiple issues that things are not working well. Hundreds of man hour wasted trying to figure out what went wrong. I guess after reading all the latest review here it is clear that inmotionhosting really do suck. I NOW TRULY AGREE THAT INMOTIONHOSTING IS IN FACT A FRAUD."
"they decided to close our account and service without giving you opportunity of recover everything when they decide that CPU or Memory resources are too high.

Without any explanation, one they you find everything is closed and when you ask them they told us its too agressive website.

bad experience with them, be aware."
"After hostgator, netfirms, and other Endurance scam hostings, I’ve found inmotion fantastic.

They’re not perfect, but given the cost, they are VERY worthwhile… not the cheapest, but totally worth the extra few $

Great support (even from Australia)."
"These guys are really amazing. Best customer support ever, even if you are not a knower. They’ll have patience.

Some tasks took a bit more than expected (migrations, etc). But for the low cost, its completely OK.

Go with the."
"I downloaded a badly coded plugin on my WP Site yestetday. Today i was unable to get back into my admin dashboard. I was locked out. I contacted Inmotion’s Customer Service; spoke with Tony W. Who had me up and running in minutes. I was completely blown away by his competence and professionalism.

Thx Tony"
"InMotionHosting are categorically the BEST hosting company on the planet. There servers are reliable (never had one single issue in the 3 years I’ve had a VPS with them) and their support staff are INCREDIBLE.

I vow to stay with InMotionHosting for life because of their customer support. I’ve always left support chats feeling super happy, and their support staff are so helpful, friendly and treat you like a human being.

I am so glad I left my previous host (and it’s associated headaches) behind.

InMotionHosting treat their customers with the utmost respect, something that is seriously lacking in the hosting industry, and that for me is the reason I’ve given them 100/100 in this review. They’re simply AWESOME"
"Right from the beginning, Inmotion and their support team have been 100% available and have answered ALL my requests and questions, sometimes spending a couple hours on the phone with a support technician. Always calm, always helpful and supportive, and very knowledgeable, each member of their staff goes above and beyond to deliver on their promise. I have NEVER experience such good customer support before."
"I finally became so frustrated with my previous host that I recently decided to change. The information provided in the Inmotion Youtube videos gave me so much help, that I decided to go with them.

I would like to say how happy I am that I did it. I have asked a million questions, and had a few hiccups that needed more assistance. Everyone has been helpful! It is the first time in many years that I felt like I was getting straight answers and the help I needed."
"I’m not kidding. The inmotion support team is wonderful. I can’t say enough.I opened a site with inmotion as they were the hosts that my online marketing education sugested. I have been with them 30 days. And it took half that time for me to decide to move my blog from another host. I now have two sites with inmotion. The support team is quick, knowledgable, nonjudgemental, open,honest and really really nice to me. Even if I ask 100 questons they have always been great!! I feel like they are on my own team and they really care about making my online career a success. THANKS TEAM YOUR THE BEST!!!"
"I moved to inMotion 4 months ago after being with Godaddy for 6 years. I can tell you that inMotion pricing, speed, uptime and load time is way better than Godaddy.

I did read lots of articles and reviews before going with inMotion hosting.

I started with their WordPress hosting but one of my sites started getting lots of traffic (5000 daily visitors), so I upgrade to VPS. That was also inMotion recommendation to avoid having my account suspended.

I have to admit that the moment I moved to inMotion, my traffic increased considerably and I started ranking #1 for lots of keywords. I don’t know if that was because I moved to inMotion or because Godaddy sucks.

Being with Godaddy for many years, inMotion Account Management Panel (AMP) and cPanel is totally new to me, so I always contact inMotion support rather than trying to figure their AMP and cPanel. Most time I use chat online which I find it faster.

Their support is great and they try their best to help you and find a solution, but some of them don’t seem to know what they are doing or talking about. Hopefully they are new hire, so you give them a change to learn and get better at what they do.

I have three websites and their VPS100 is sufficient for me at the moment. Their pricing is not the cheapest but one of my sites already pays for it. Their support is not the best, but they are always available (at least online), willing to help and find the best solution for your problem. Speed and page load, my ranking has improved and traffic to my revenue making site has increased considerably.

Bottomline, inMotion hosting is fit for my purpose and can be for yours depending on what you need.

By the way, have you checked their tutorial? They have lots of them in their main site."
"From getting me started with a transfer from “another host” and Joomla to their servers and WordPress, to helping me easily move into web development on my own, IMH has consistently proven to be the best decision I’ve made regarding my work. The tech support outshines any I’ve been in contact with. Personable, professional, and prompt! They’re there for my success."
"We haven’t been too happy with inmotionhosting but just like any average relationship we got along. Until they suspended our account, that is. Without prior warning or information they took down our website, shop and support system just because we allegedly took more bandwidth than we should have. Any professional hosting service would have informed us that we were about to reach a limit and that the downloads might slow down if we exceeded that limit. But inmotionhosting just deleted the whole thing. Good job!

Oh, and instead of informing us of taking our whole web server down they let us find out the hard way.

The 20/100 are because we were more or less happy before this – but for anyone looking for a professional web hosting service that company should be a no-go."
"After cycling through Rackspace, AWS, and GoDaddy for VPS hosting I’ve been very impressed with both the cost and service offered by InMotion. My wait times for phone support have been consistently under 1 minute and often less. Their reps seem to be, with few exceptions, knowledgable and equipped to handle just about every problem I’ve had. My only complaint is there was some downtime on my server. They did extend my hosting for free in exchange, but, of course, downtime is downtime…"
"I’ve been with InMotion for many years now, and having used several other hosts in the past can say with confidence InMotion is the best. Their fees are more than reasonable, and – most importantly to me as a 1-person show – their customer service is bar none. Whenever I have an issue – which is rare – I can contact the InMotion team quickly via online chat, phone, or email, and get the issue resolved fast. Usually the tech will fix the issue for me online, but also explain what the problem and fix was so I can correct it myself in future. All in all, I’m very happy with all aspects of InMotion."
"Customer service great at first, then soured shortly after, within 30 days. For more complex configurations on VPS such as varnish, nginx proxy, etc, be prepared to spend a lot of money paying for the “managed hosting” the top tier support which the provide. They have 3 levels of support, but not all tiers are built equally, meaning that you may get different answers from different tiers. Depending on your needs, the hosting might be sufficient for you. But if you’re looking for something more custom or more optimized for performance, be prepared to spend extra money out of pocket."
"I finally purchased a dedicated WP hosting plan at Inmotion due to a guy calling himself WPcrafter who is obviously afffiliated with them. But already during the first week I experienced countless 504, 503, 502 errors which made me quite nervous considering that my WP was light and without (fortunately) much contents. Some days the site was just gone for long periods at a time. Couldn't even log in to my WP admin panel. The people at Inmotion are very friendly and I had hoped for successful relationship with them. They could not locate the problem and told me that if they can't replicate the error themselves there is nothing they can do. That answer made me sweat. IMO should there really be any teething problems on this level? I made a quick decision, just one week in, and exported my data and shut the site down. I asked for a refund which they promised to issue. So we will see. My big big concern with all these popular hosting sites are that they are promoted and pushed by tens of thousands of money hungry affiliates. This makes it really really hard to believe any reviews, honestly!"
"Inmotion hosting replies fast to your queries, but they are ABSOLUTELY HORRID in fixing issues. I moved from reseller to VPS, paid for SIX MONTHS in advance... they never migrated my site properly. My site worked fine as reseller, just a bit slow, so I moved to VPS, now I constantly get database crashes, empty promises that ""this time its fixed"" only to have to crash again and again and again. Finally, I escalated to the manager who admitted that during migration, they missed something, and its been fixed. But clearly NO, because few days later, I'm getting database and server errors. I've lost thousands of dollars using inmotion hosting, they never fixed the issues, my database is completely corrupted because their migration was SO BAD. BEWARE!!!!!"
"I am having some technical difficulties during the implementation of my agency and all the problems that are appearing are being solved by the excellent technical staff. Today I was able to enable Let's Encrypt for all my developing sites, and in the previous months, to implement HTTP2, and migrate to the VPS plan. Soon I will go to the Dedicated. I strongly recommend, because apart from the servers are great, the team ALWAYS solves the problems and this is what you can not miss in a hosting service. For those who develop websites and are not a server expert, better leave the more complex tasks to their team."
"Since we changed the server to VPS on our second account, we had all sort of problem, worst than all was that the IP they assigned was a used up one and was blacklisted by so many global filter companies. Until this gets resolved we won't have an email coming. Horrible! and when I talk to them, they say they are running a scan and that's it; nothing else. Exactly the same thing happened for our first account and I thought it was an unlucky situation; but this time I realized it is not coincidence, they are assigning garbage IPs for their new VPS customers."
"So I was just reading some of these reviews... and wow - while some are nice - others are just, well... brutal. Being a business owner myself, I understand it only takes one or two grumpy people to tarnish a very good thing - in whatever you do. Now I am not saying anyone's experience isn't as it is... I just want to share my experience here as well.

I came over from another hosting company - one that is most likely the biggest (that's a hint). And to me the customer experience is no comparison. InMotionHosting is top notch. I *consistently* get top-level, personalized support. I *consistently* learn something.

Having hosted all my sites (about 10) through InMotionHosting has been probably one of the best decisions I have made. Over the last two years I have developed many techniques to optimize my site through their guidance... one conversation at a time. We so often think it is another's responsibility to fix our issues... If we come with a slightly different attitude - one of looking to learn - this company will be a veritable goldmine.

Pages load fast. Uptime consistent. And they are available 24/7. And they aren't in a rush to get you off the phone like some other providers (who answer as if you are interrupting their day). Solid company. Solid people. I definitel"
"Beware. They sell your data to Quanki.com who they also host, and will refuse to remove it under any circumstance. You actually have more luck going directly to Quanki.com that via InMotion.

I emailed their legal department and gave them evidence of harassment etc that was coming directly from them publicly hosting my private information, they at first completely ignored me, then replied to my second email saying they're not willing to do anything. They weren't even willing to take the information down in the face of a police report.

No morals or human decency. Just because you don't HAVE to do something legally, it doesn't mean you shouldn't look at the situation from a human perspective rather than the bottom line of your bank account."
"I will tell you just one thing. Over the years InMotion Hosting quality went from 100 to 1.

I have one business account (shared hosting but business), and it seems that I have lost the last 6 months of my work. Because their website makes them look so safe...but the last backup they had of the server where my customers' websites were hosted is dated NOVEMBER 2017.

And when I contacted them (more than once) they had a different excuse every single time. The last one is that they take copies of websites and so on every 24-36 hours, but only if the account is below 10Gb. Well my account did not reach 10Gb of disk space, and anyway I should have been informed of such policy and, last but not least, can you be so stupid and enforce such policy? I mean, I would understand if they told me that over 10Gb they take a weekly backup or every two weeks...but passing from 24-36 hours to 6 months? It was obviously a poor excuse.

I am quite tempted to post the whole chat I had with them...lol"
"I would not recommend inmotion to anyone. They reply for your chat immediately but there is no proper way of handling tickets. In motion is good if you don't want any updates or upgrades to your server once you purchase it. Your headache starts If you notice any issue and request them to fix it. There is no proper way of handling ticket, multiple persons will be handling the ticket. They fix one issue you will get another one and it goes on. This is how they work."
"Today I inadvertently deleted my website with one absent-minded double-click. I contacted InMotion Hosting tech support and within hours they completed a FREE data restoration, and my website was up and running again. I'm just an amateur, and I was in a complete panic until William Wa. saved the day and told me how to get my website back. I highly recommend InMotion Hosting. They've helped me numerous times over the years, and I don't know what I'd do without their tech support."
"I've been with InMotion for 2 years now and I have mixed feelings about them. InMotion advertises their hosting plans as including a FREE domain (free in bold caps). However, in their terms of service, they quietly list the domain as free for only one year and then you have to pay for domain renewal in addition to the hosting package. It's not a huge deal, but it's not what I thought I was getting. To me, this qualifies as a deceptive practice, so, just take this into consideration if you are considering using them to host your site. As far their tech support goes, they have been great compared to other hosts I have used. The waiting time to chat (or speak) to someone is usually pretty short (less than 5 min in my experience) and so far they have been knowledgeable enough to answer my questions and they've always solved my problems. Be aware that I said ""so far"" because I have had horrible experiences with other domain hosts in the past as I'm sure many of you have had, so I know what can happen."
"Great uptime stats, a bit slow but it is quite cheap. I would recommend it. I always recommend you use some form of WordPress managed hosting. These are hosts that cater specifically to WordPress websites. Their servers are usually better configured, caching is already set up for you, and their support is more knowledgeable about WordPress issues."
"I not only got individual hosting for Wordpress but got a VPS as well. This has to be the slowest hosting I have ever worked with in 17+ years. The support is not good and the rep got smart with me about the speed, telling me if I wanted a better loading time it would cost more than the almost $250 I paid for the year. Host Gator has them beat by miles. Don't waste your money."
"I do love their support they are always helpful, em, no not always, there were chats with totally unprofessional guys. Moreover, when I contacted them the next time they were surprised Inmotion representatives can promise such things. Downtimes happen too often. They moved my site to another server and as a result, it looked like a mess for 2 days!"
"I have a 'reseller' account with them that I used as a sandbox. A couple of months ago I contacted them stating that I no longer needed this account configuration and requested they download me to a plan that could accommodate my requirement of hosting to URL's. Both have minimal traffic so I expected it to be straightforward. I contacted support and they worked with their technical team to confirm that the Pro plan for $17 a month would work. I paid for the month and expected this to be completed.

A few weeks later my main domain was not available. I contacted them and was told the downgrade had been canceled and it would cost me $39.99 to get access to my site, email, and data again. I requested a call with management and this is where things went downhill... I was told this was my fault because I didn't speak with their technical team directly instead requesting their support rep talk with them. My requirements were simple (see above, that's all of them) however it appears there was an issue with the reseller accounts each having their own c-panel. I'm not sure how me speaking with them would have prevented this issue. I was also told no discounts or credits would be applied to my account. After being scapegoated and chastised I gave up. I only stated that this was not my area of expertise and this expertise is what I was paying for, they did not care.

This was only the latest issue I've had with this company.

Overall I did not find their uptime or speed any better than previous hosting companies."
"I was with Inmotion Hosting for many months before deciding to pull my service. I had a DMCA complaint due to an over seas developer error that was corrected and then reversed causing me to have account outages multiple times. InMotion was incompetent the entire time and provided no access to their ""legal"" department for direct communication, therefore I experienced site outages causing me losses. They may have competitive pricing and decent quality of service but they're customer does not first in these cases and they need to be open and communicative to understanding the situation."
"I hosted with InMotion on a ""PRO"" server, installed Wordpress, and thought I was good to go.

In Motion Hosting SEEMED great -- until they (quickly) began to THROTTLE my site big time. To conserve resources I installed a Heartbleed plugin, caching, and made other adjustments. Still saw big time throttling and terrible latency, especially in the back end.

It was so bad that I was regularly seeing up to 30 SECOND LATENCY in the back end when clicking on just about anything -- generally not as bad on the front end, but at times there too. Numerous calls to InMotion yielded excellent tech support and good response but no useful solution(s) at all.

I've had Wordpress installations on many other hosts and frankly InMotion's throttling is the worst I've experienced anywhere -- and virtually CONTINUOUS. It was a very poor solution for a Wordpress installation and was, frankly, unusable.

I had to take down the site after only a few weeks and am now searching for a replacement.

Everything else advertised I generally found to be accurate -- its servers were reasonably fast, support was excellent, uptime great, ease of use (CPANEL and FTP access) simple... BUT THE THROTTLING WAS DISASTROUS AND ENDLESS.

Sorry InMotion, I've been elsewhere and experienced ZERO or minimal throttling if any with an identical installation. Your incessant and aggressive throttling at least for me made use of a Wordpress installation impossible."
"I used InMotion several years ago. I must say that their service was decent by then. Last year, I made a terrible mistake by giving them another try since their VPS was a bit cheaper. My God, I was wrong. My site went to the gutter in SEO. For certain keywords, my site used to be on the first page on Google. Right after I moved to Inmotion, my site went to page 20 then 30 and then literally disappeared when entering a few key words. I really could not understand what went wrong. We we did not change the content of the site. I did a bit of research and found out that the static IP that InMotion gave us was also being used for other web sites. I suspect that the CPanel licence was not exclusive to my web site either. It was a real nightmare. There were hundreds of damaging back links. When I said ""hundreds"" I do not mean it literally. There were about 6 or 7 hundreds back-links referring to other websites but still pointing to my site. Once I cancelled my service and went to another provider, keywords like ""creole translation"" ""haitian creole translation"" generated great Google placement in SEO. We got back to first page. It was a real disappointing experience. if your business relies on SEO, be very careful with InMotion hosting."
"I can start out by saying there isn't much 'positive' about Inmotionhosting. The only positive would be their quick customer support BUT there would be no need to contact customer support if they didn't have so many problems.

Biggest issue that too a huge effect on my company is that they shut down my website on a Friday because I needed to send a document to them by the end of the week. I sent it back that evening but when I sent it back that specific support team had already left the office for the weekend. I called, I contacted regular support via chat and they said they would be back on Monday, they don't answer their emails on the weekends.

SOOOO that siad, my website was shut down all weekend and lost 50% of its traffic because they decided to shut my site down on a Friday and not answer on the weekend to an urgent matter. Just unacceptable!

That would be only ONE of the bad experiences I've had with Inmotionhosting. Browse other hosting options before you look into selecting inmotionhosting. I do not recommend them."
"All our websites and email systems have been down for almost a day and we receive no whatsoever support from inmotion. The live chat support says it has been passed on to the System Administrations Team, but we are not allowed to speak to them. We would be contacted once it works again.

That was ten hours ago. Since then our whole company has no email, our websites dont work and we have no idea what to do.

On live chat they told us we can reply to the support email we will get, which is a bit of a joke considering that our whole email system is down because of inmotion.

Dont buy them!"
"Avoid this company at all costs. Our websites kept crashing right after we renewed our . Also, there is NO WAY you can get a refund so they are basically stealing your money if you hate their service. We had live products launched that kept crashing for days (and we were losing sales because of that) so they forced us to give them more money so they would dispatch more traffic to us.

Also, they will not accept PayPal payments (and online company mind you) because they want to have your credit card in their system.

It has the worst customer support I've encountered that say lines like (and I am not joking) ""This is how technology works and that is why it's slow"". They have no idea what they're talking about.

This is literally the single worst hosting company I ever encountered, avoid them because you will lose money, traffic, time and nerves."
"For comparing, Inmotion VPS plan is worse than much cheaper shared plan on Siteground, it is slower, websites can be inaccessible, and at the times slower than usual, which is a total shame for the money they charge. Support is also a disgrace. When you have pre-sale questions, the support will answer you within 30 seconds, but when you have any technical issues, you will wait for 30, 45 minutes. After waiting for that much, support can answer, and if you are not there within literally few seconds to respond, they will close the chat for inactivity? Even when they answer, they tend not to fix your problem, so you have to contact a few times. This is my 3rd hosting provider in the last 4 years, and definitely the worst one. Can't wait to forever leave these scammers!"
"Lately, I've just been getting one problem after another. I keep calling, waiting half an hour to talk to someone, they fix the issue (eventually) only to introduce a new error. Honestly, I've lost all confidence in their ability to run a smooth operation. Shame. Been with them 7 years, but not much longer."
"We just discovered that Inmotion has a very big gap of performance regarding mass mailing. They suspend your account if you use their Smtp settings to send mass emails. Their system is not strong enough to support mass mailing.

If you are a company be it small or big and that you need to send mass emails to your customers then do not use Inmotion services Hostetter seems to be more performant in that. They allow mass mailing and the sending is 99x faster than Inmotion.

So to those willing to use their mailing list or to get in with their customers through mailing do not chose Inmotion they are not good in that too weak for that hostgator is stronger faster and better go there.

This is a true review based on real life experience. We can provide proves of that. We have been obliged to delete 12 email accounts from our hosting account with Inmotion to create 15 néw emails with hostgator.

We sent over 55600 emails with hostgator and so far no problem but with Inmotion we sent 4200 and our email account was suspended for too much emails sent.

I hope this review can help companies and privates in their choices

Thanks

Success to you"
"I have been a customer of IMH for just under 10 years. This year I finally decided to get serious about developing a web based business. Read carefully the previous review about email marketing before EVER using IMH for business purposes (""Email Sending Issues"" December 31st, 2018 review here).

While researching search engines and how they rank you within their searches I discovered that the number of ""clicks"" to a site determines where you rank in a search on a search engine.

Once I had fully developed my site and implemented it in production on a VPS platform at IMH I used a tool provided by IMH to generate email ""campaigns"" which are marketing email intended to generate ""clicks"" to your website. Before doing this I communicated with IMH support because in the past some other large emails I had sent using the ""shared"" hosting not the VPS solution had gotten my domain suspended (not a good practice if you are going to support eCommerce as a hosting company). I had moved my domains to VPS thinking that IMH would be more flexible with this policy. WRONG!

After communicating with IMH support I throttled the PHPList app (the app that IMH provided) to the recommended settings under 240 email per hour (I set it to 203) and after a couple of campaigns I set PHPList to only send 1 email to the same domain every half hour (this kept me from alarming yahoo mail servers and a couple of college mail servers and mostly avoided greylisting).

Last night IMH canceled my account (My business website is now inop thanks to IMH). In the article the author asks the question ""Is IMH resting on it laruals""? The answer is a resounding YES! They have not kept up with what reality is in the eCommerce era and their policies are in direct opposition to developing and marketing an eCommerce site.

Just a side note. Until last night IMH Support in my mind had been excellent. I am an Information Technology Systems Engineer (I build and support hardware and sometimes need help with software and settings) and there are times when support gave me direction and let me resolve my issues and other times I turned it over to them and they took care of it.

If you are just blogging you are fine as long as you don't email your members newsletters etc. I would not recommend any type of eCommerce site be hosted by IMH on any of their services.

MY SINCERE RECOMMENDATION IS TO RUN FROM INMOTIONHOSTING AND DON'T LOOK BACK!"
"They have no adequate backup plan for your email, maybe even your website. Just found out that my email has been deleted, 20 years worth, and all they can say is that their backup of yesterday does not have any content. They told me they do not archive emails at specific points of time, so their backup plan is to overwrite the previous backup. Really that is a backup service. They basically have wiped out my email history and have no way of recovering it!!!! I'm a small business that relies on my emails. I backup up my standard data nightly but fully expected a provider to at least backup my emails.

What kind of provider runs like this??????"
"I'm still a customer of inmotion hosting but if they keep going down the road they are at, it's not going to be for long.

I have a VPS account and got a warning that crawlers were abnormally hitting the website. I went to check and inmotion had taken down the website. After talking with support i did some preventive measures recommended by inmotion to try to reduce the crawl hit and that was it.

However 2 weeks later i start to notice a traffic drop, pages showing up on search results in a weird way and by chance i checked the htaccess file. That's when i found out that someone from inmotion had tampered with the file and basically it was blocking all traffic from any bot. I was like seriously?!

In conclusion, inmotion asked me to take action and i did what they had recommended but they went behind my back and blocked crawler access to the website. In my book this is a serious offense and i'm not going to leave things as they are.

Thank you for reading."
"I have both dedicated and shared hosting accounts with IMH. The dedicated account is great, and their customer service for dedicated accounts is also top notch. The shared hosting account is a whole other matter. There are constant errors when creating domains, and the tech help people are not the same and don't provide the same service on a shared hosting account. The dedicated server people will spend all kinds of time making sure things are working properly, going above and beyond the call of duty in most cases. The shared people tell you things like, ""We don't handle xxxx, this is your problem"". (Not those exact words, but you get the point.)

I'd recommend them if you're doing a dedicated server, but they're completely average when it comes to what most inexperienced people have, shared hosting. I sometimes ponder why they would provide such a difference in service, particularly when a person with a dedicated server usually has much more expertise than someone on a shared plan. It's sort of like kicking you when you're down, if you know what I mean."
"When I started with InMotion I paid up for two years reseller hosting in advance. There were no problems at all to begin with but uptime is a real issue now along with speed. They deny the speed issue each time I speak to them but it is obvious if you keep a constant eye on your sites loading times.

And guess what, the login to the admin is down right as I submit this. You wouldn't read about it."
"Switched to them. Had a week where I could not get email running, and NO ONE responded to emails, chat was clogged for hours on end, and even called the sales rep who was so ""I am all over it"" when I started, said it is not my issue, and I can't either help or get you any help. Finally got going, and a month or so later needed to set up an IMAP account on my android phone..works fine for sending, but absolutely not functioning for incoming. Chatted once after a long wait, sent another email, and 24 hours later no response. (But they promote they have 24/7 support. Plus, for some reason, my new email address is reportedly, by many contacts, going to their spam folders. I regret hooking up with them, and hate to change again because it is a problem in many ways, but if this doesn't get any better I will."
"They seemed okay (more or less on par with other hosts I have used over the years) until recently. I've received several e-mails about their new automated backup service that they're offering for free for 90 days. When I went to login to CPanel today, I saw a note saying that the free service will end in 80'ish days, and then I will be automatically charged for the time remaining on my contract. I did have the option to cancel said service, but I had to cancel said service, else be charged. Mind you, this is not a service I asked for. It is not a service I signed up for. It is something they just gave me, and then were going to charge for after the free bit ended. I contacted them and suggested this was illegal (or it should be). If not, at least unethical. I'm going elsewhere as a direct result of this before my contract ends. I would advise you to avoid such an unethical company, too."
"I had an account with over 48 websites. InMotionHosting sent me an email that ended up in my spam folder. Two days later I found the email saying I had malware, just as my websites all went dark. InMotionHosting put my entire account into quarantine, and refused to tell me what malware I had, and where it was. So I went to use the Cpanel Malware Scanning tool, but low and behold it was missing. But there was an invitation to use their Partner - Securi to clean up my account. Securi wanted $1800. A yearly account with Securi would cost $200 per domain. Hmmmm, something feels a bit fishy.

My account was locked down. I couldn't scan the files. I couldn't use a tool over ssh to scan the files as that was locked down. In other words I was in a Catch 22 situation. After being held hostage for over a week, I finally found other hosting. Told them of my plight, and they said no problem. They copied over a backup of my Cpanel, scanned the quarantined files, and provided a log of the malware and location of the files. I was able to clean up the files, and use the Cpanel Malware Scanner that used to be in Cpanel at InMotionHosting to check and double check all my files. Copied over to public_html, and my sites are back up and running.

InMotionHosting failed at customer service. InMotionHosting probably propagated the malware through other accounts and made me and countless others pay. InMotionHosting will not refund the money for the unused portion of my prepaid year of hosting.

Oh, if you have high traffic on one or more of your websites, you will be throttled, and your users will complain of a very slow website. The InMotionHosting shared Database Servers are barely chugging along at times.

In short, runaway from InMotionHosting."
"I've been a long time InMotion customer for many websites. Originally, on shared server and more recently on VP. Used to love their customer service/technical support. In the last year it has deteriorated to the point of useless. Today's queue to chat I was number 69. Tech support (when finally got through) has been inexperienced far more often than not and even occasionally just lied or guessed and had to be walked through. Once in a while I get a gem of a tech support person which used to be their standard but now the exception rather than the rule. If I weren't so busy at the moment I'd (with enormous regret) have already switched to another company. That is a move I will be making when I have the time. I do not recommend and that is after years of referring business associates to them. I've asked what the problem is on several occasions. New ownership looking for bonuses by cutting back on service? They say no. They've acknowledged there's a problem but won't elaborate. If I thought it was a growth issue I'd stick around but they don't want to elaborate and I don't want to be left in the dark about an essential business service. Frankly, after the last year's experience, I would not use them if they were free, as without support it has no value to me. I'll miss them as they were excellent at one time."
"We have used InMotion for 3 years, hosting a SQL database that we used for the core of our small business, maybe 6-8 user connections.

In 9 May 19 IM told us that we had too many dwelling connections, and we had to change our software or lift our plan to VPS. Fine, so we started developing software to make the change.

On 13 June we were disconnected. Permanently. No 48hr notice email, nothing. Just an email saying our connections had been suspended. InMotion Systems support did not want to know, did not even want to switch us back on to allow software testing at our end to complete, totally obstructive and difficult.

To cap it off, they also disabled access to our C Panel, so we could not even get a copy of our data out !! After some calls to Accounts (V helpful) they sent us a ZIP file of our data, not even switched us back on for 24 hrs to allow access!!

AVOID INMOTION unless you want the systems nazi's to kill your business and put your valuable data in danger. I would not go back if they paid me."
"Wow I am not a customer but my customer is and he was dealt with in the most callous and arrogant fashion. He had a mysql db hosted with them, <300mb and they insisted he change the way it was accessed, fair enough. They engaged us to make this change but before testing was complete they cut him off refusing to even accommodate him for 2 weeks. This application had been running for 3 years with no issue. reasons given were to ""stabilize the server"". Scary if things are this fragile. The contact refused to budge, extorted a very expensive upgrade to access their data. Obviously very stressed as his business was being held to ransom he called back and through another staff member was at least able to get a complete dump of his site and we were able to move the data to a more reputable host. I have never seen such a poor and arrogant response and was appalled. Do yourself a favour and find a better option, if I could give less than one star I would."
"We've been with inmotion for a couple of years now and they have forced us to shop around and to get out of this terrible company. About 6 months ago we had WHM and our website down everyday and their support or chat gets flooded by users and no way to get help. Message almost always is: west coast servers technical issues that are being resolved. Plus our server got hacked and we tried many many times to get them to secure their servers with no luck and we had to pay out of our own pocket to have things fixed. SO anyways, save yourself a headache and do NOT deal with inmotion hosting."
"I woke up one day to find IMH had lost 5 critical data tables. ALL of the content from my entire site, gone. When I asked them to restore it, they told me I was out of luck because my site took up too much memory (>10 GB), and so by default the server was not backing it up due to my hosting plan. It's fortunate that my developer had a manual backup from 2 months ago. But still, they two entire months of article and valuable metadata. And, if you look at IMH advertising on their home, they claim that restoring the data is available upon request. I was very upset when I found that they had lost the data and could not restore it."
"I'm using business plan for two years. I believed the domain fee is included in the monthly fee, but it was included for only the first term of contract, and they applied regular domain fee from this year. It was not written ANYWHERE in website, so customers are easily mislead to believe domain fee is included in server plans. I think this is false advertising.

Also, they added Backup Manager service without my permission. It is for free for the first contract term, but will be charged after the first contract ends. Fortunately I noticed it and canceled the service before they charge on me, otherwise, I had to pay another fee for unwanted service. Through these experiences, I don't trust InMotion Hosting.

However, server performance is stable enough and I don't want to waste my time to change my hosting server again... so I will be using the company for a while. Just be careful and check your bill periodically if you use it."
"Last two chats I initialized for questions I had to do with my accounts, the first chat was null and void. The representative had NO IDEA what Site Builder was, a feature in the Control panels. Didn't even know they provided it. So there went any chance of me knowing how to work around an error I kept getting. He didn't attempt to transfer me to someone with knowledge either.

Second chat attempt, I'm simply asking where I can find a complete list of all the CP services and features. I was sent to a page that has a bullet of 10 features. I asked for a complete list and was ignored for another 40 minutes after I repeatedly asked if someone was still there. No answer.

I’ve been a customer for many years and I'm not feeling the love. Time to go somewhere else. I've sent chat transcripts to the manager for feedback, I receive apologies but still can't get help when I need it."
"For me, inmotionhosting has no comparison with other hosting services. Prices are commensurate with the plan you want, and in my case, I have two plans with them. One dedicated and another VPS.

For those who want to have a serious business on the Internet, inmotion is the most suitable, especially for the exceptional support service.

All my problems are always 100% solved, either via chat or via ticket. I've tried other hosts in the past, I've been a siteground client, where chat technicians understand almost nothing of what to do, very different from the highly skilled inmotion chat team, which is of the same quality (ie maximum quality) as those who serve via ticket.

It's an amazing team that even in a situation where I wanted to do something that I thought was via server, they solved my problem by giving me custom PHP code for my wordpress. This time it was way above my expectations.

I've had dozens of advanced settings that I asked to do for myself on NGINX, CPANEL, WHM, DNS, just to name a few, helped me defend myself and stop DDoS attacks.

If you have to compare hosting service vs. hosting service without giving HUGE IMPORTANCE to the technical staff who will be by your side for years helping you, you can take a big risk of having your online business paralyzed even for days if there is a serious problem."
"I am very happy with InMotion Hosting. The support has been fast and accurate, providing the right fix or answer up front. My needs are basic and InMotion has provided great service."
"I moved from GoDaddy to Inmotion on the strength of a recommendation, and they have not disappointed. Inmotion has always been available to support my attempt to launch a website, I am a newbie, and totally unfamiliar with the process. My phone calls, online chats, and their customer service representatives, and there have been several, have all been patient, kind, and understanding. They have even caught my errors for me, fixed them, and got me back in the swing of things.

This is also the first experience with Wordpress as a website authoring tool. So far, it's been a good experience, as well. I'm expecting the rest of the development process will go just as well, and I'll be launching my own website in a few days. Getting my site email up, on all my devices, was quick, and easy. That was a huge relief for me."
"I have to say, I'm shocked to see all these negative reviews of IMH as I've had nothing but a positive experience with them over the past 3+ years, especially their tech support. I've used the shared hosting plans for my site and my clients and have always connected with support (I mainly use Chat) quickly - like under 5 minutes - and have had very friendly, knowledgeable folks that have gone above and beyond to make sure things were worked out quickly and correctly. This is the main reason I've been recommending them to my clients because I know I can get good support quickly and consistently. Unless things change drastically, I'm happy to stay with IMH and will continue to recommend them to my clients."
"I have dozens of websites and I like to use a low cost host like in motion for temporary sites and other small projects that don't need ""real hosting"". So far I have had 2 sites hacked, and 2 other sites randomly loose database connection. Chat always gives a warning that there is high volume and long wait times, I mean even at 2AM. Time to migrate to another low cost host."
"Website and email went down. First time I'd had a problem in the last year. Apart from a LONG wait in the queue, I was impressed with a knowledgeable reply to my query, and a helpful follow-up web chat later (in terms not too technical for me) has almost resolved the issue. The exception is that my British ISP hasn't resolved some DNS issues, but that's not Inmotion's fault. I'd recommend them."
We started out with the Power Plan and upgraded to the VPS to access more resources. The experience has been excellent so far. Their support is responsive and friendly. Their service is very flexible in switching between plans. They offer great website transfers without downtime.
"For two days, their website did nothing but spin when I would click any options. Against my better judgment, I still transferred three websites to them. Two of the requests to transfer instantly failed, after calling repeatedly, I was told the email addresses weren't valid, despite having received the emails the transfer was in process. Finally fed up, I called customer service and asked to be refunded all the money that I had paid. The customer service agent was argumentative and refused to refund all of my money for the non-working transfers.

Today, I get notified the business website I have on this site is being glitchy, so I attempt to log into WordPress, as I have on at least two other occasions. Oddly enough, my login suddenly doesn't exist, and I can't access my website. Unknown if this is related to yesterday, or if they just simply don't have it together.

I will not be using this service again."
"Your web URLs will be case sensitive, causing 404-not found errors on the simplest case typos. This can have a huge negative impact on search engine ranking. They block your IP is they detect a few failed password attempts to any of their resources, essentially locking you out of the management of your own website. They misconfigured my website so that FTP and MySQL didn't work at all, and erroneously created a rogue whitelist containing an unrelated IP address that prevented me from access many hosting resources. AMP and cPanel are often excruciatingly slow (even unresponsive at times), and FTP can take most of the night to upload a single website. Shared servers are so taxed with so many websites that they recently had a server farm meltdown that took thousands of websites down for over an hour. Requests to move me off the affected servers so I could get my website back online were systematically ignored. When adding one of the free 'Add-on' domains, you find that they also create a piggy-back subdomain of the same name with your main domain. This 'back door' to your add-on domain cannot be hidden or disabled. This company may have been pretty good in the past, and they control much of the reviews about them on the Internet, but their shared hosting services are barely reliable enough for personal websites. Don't use them for your business websites no matter how economically attractive they initially appear to be."
We run several dedicated servers and found that InMotion Hosting was the most incompetent and irresponsible. We've found that there were back-end cluster API issues that prevented our customers from sending and receiving mail properly. These are the settings that can only be changed by the host. I contacted support no less than 200 times in one year trying to resolve an avalanche of problems. They would fix one issue and create 4 new issues to deal with. We had other issues when billing didn't auto-draft and shutting down our server. When we went to renew they wanted double. You will receive push-back and attitude from support when you are in dire need to resolve issues that they caused. InMotion Hosting destroyed our company and caused irreparable harm to us and our customers. Choosing InMotion hosting was the biggest mistake I've made for my business and my future.
"I don't know how they compute their availability numbers, but they are totally false. They have had an ongoing east-coast network-wide service outage for the last 3 days that does not get reflected in those numbers. Server performance goes down significantly as they overpopulate it with hosting clients, to the extent they bring everything down. FTP services can take all night just to upload your site. The subfolders of URLs are treated as case-sensitive, sending visitors 404 page not found errors for the most trivial improper case usage. You can't add an Add-On domain without creating a backdoor subdomain on your primary domain you started service with, which is pretty sloppy. You can't even hide or disable the subdomain alternate access to your addon websites. Most of their technical department is pretty incompetent, taking an entire day to set-up a basic website with numerous problems like erroneous whitelisting some goofy IP I had nothing to do with. If somewhere along the line you accidentally flub a password to any of their resources a few times, their firewall locks you out of complete access to your own site by blocking your IP. This includes your site's management portal. And the final straw is their 'unlimited' disk and bandwidth availability to shared hosting clients is a lie. They will enforce restrictions at random if they feel your usage could impact performance of any others on their overloaded servers. Bottom line is even at their lowest price offerings at just $3.99/mo., you still won't even get what you pay for. These folks may have been pretty good at one time, but now they are just someone you want to stay clear of. If you doubt anything I\'ve said, you can go online with a chat with them at https://secure1.inmotionhosting.com/amp/chat/amp-pre-chat. But be prepared to get some less than courteous responses to some of these pointed questions."
"InMotion came highly recommended, so I moved my large iphone photography site there a year ago. There have been all sorts of issues ever since, mostly downtime, and often very slow load time of pages. I am happy to say that I have migrated my site to another ISP. I'm afraid InMotion is like so many other ISPs I've encountered over the past twenty-five years of building website: great early on, but then they get sold or greedy and overload their servers and services decline."
"I'm just an average Joe with a few websites. I'm banging my head against the wall spending hours looking for hosting. I have enough experience to know cheap hosting SUCKS! I spent a few extra bucks and tried In Motion Hosting. I've been with them for 4 years now and I am NEVER going back to cheap hosting or any hosting using email support. In Motion has awesome support with LIVE CHAT! Anything I can't fix, they fix for me...and they are happy to do it. Just stop looking at other hosting companies and go with In Motion."
"I’ll get to the point – I have been so impressed by InMotion’s customer service that when I recently had the occasion to reconsider my webhost I didn’t bother to look at other options. I’ve been a client for several years and have consistently found the team to be generous with their time and expertise. As someone whose knowledge of websites is limited to using a template and adding a little CSS and HTML, customer service is paramount to me. This was especially appreciated these past few weeks when I undertook the task of revamping my hosting plan and rebuilding my site. From the sales and billing crew to the awesome technical support staff, everyone was courteous and respectful; quick to respond and worked with me to resolve any issues I had. InMotion has my back and that is why I remain a happy and satisfied client."
"I have used a number of hosting companies over the 30 years I have had accounts and all start out good but as they grow or get over taken, support and tech performance drops. On average I have stayed on a host 6 years each. The prior one started great, very personal service which I recommended to others until I couldn't and had problems for a couple years before giving up and rebuilding on another host. These are Virtual Private Server accounts and host a number of my web sites. From a happy developer I tried InMotion and from day one, the included options, speed and not hassle impressed me but as as sites got heavier in MySQL calls, I noticed a curious trend, everything keep getting faster. I had a real problem transferring important database files from the old host, but making the move to InMotion was so smooth and when asking for assistance, the response was immediate. OK, the options, price and performance has been great and only improve with time but what, for me, stands out the most is the incredibly fast, accurate and pleasant dealing with support. I do not need it often, and when I do, it is always something I did wrong and they find it and correct it in seconds to minutes. But everything has been smooth with no contact with support for several years and suddenly I had a PHP problem on the sites that used it (wordpress, Joomla, etc). I tried to figure it out myself but after not having any dealings with the sites that had been flawless for years, I had forgotten how to even go about it(I am a business person who writes PHP scripts for specific functions and I am not a qualified Admin) so I contacted support via the Chat interface although there are alternatives to chat. The time before my query was answered was less than 2 minutes. The person who replied was not in that department of tech support but had all my records and specifics and asked me to hold on for 8-10 minutes while he arranged for the people who did handle PHP issues. In 3 minutes he returned to the chat saying the problem was a mistake in an update and to hold on 8-10 minutes. In 4 minutes he returned and replied they found the problem and corrected it and asked my to check all the sites. They all returned. All contacts have been friendly, professional and FAST. It has been so trouble-free, I forget about the sites and attend to business, whereas in the past I spend 1/2-1/3 of my time on web and email issues before Inmotion. This account is for VPS(twice the features and 1/2 the price of my prior hosted VPS). I am guessing that the same high standards are applied to support with shared accounts also.

"I've been with IMH since April. I should've left after the first few weeks when they couldn't even migrate my sites over properly - they were up and down constantly so I lost a lot of traffic and revenue. When you switch to most other hosts there is no downtime. Every issue I've had, support is abysmal. My sites went down three different times in the past month for several hours at a time with no explanation. Their % uptime claim is a LIE. The last time my site went down and I tried to contact support with no luck - finally I got a voicemail that they suspended my site! I tried to access it and there was a huge warning for all visitors that my site was suspended. No prior warning to me whatsoever. When I called upset, they couldn't even explain why they did it! I finally just switched hosts again and now I don't have to worry about the idiots at IMH. The final blow is that they force you to call them to cancel - and they want to charge a $50 cancellation fee after all the money I've already lost because of them. What a JOKE."
"My WooCommerce website has experienced intermittent outages that InMotion Hosting support cannot explain or fix. A little over 3 months ago, they said I should upgrade to a private IP which I did and nothing changed. Nothing. The slow speed has continued even after optimizing my WP site and getting a higher GTMetrix score than another site hosted with HostGator. I am now told to upgrade to VPS for a better experience. I am planning to transfer this site to HostGator whose customer support is very slow of course, but at least their hardware is robust and eliminates the need for constant customer support.

My short version is: InMotion Hosting is NOT reliable for an online learning portal or a WooCommerce site. Even the Pro Plan that I am on is not reliable. Be careful. Extremely careful!!"
"I am a freelance web designer who started out 4 years ago with Go Daddy. I thought for most of that time that they were awesome, until I realized they weren’t. After reaching 30+ sites online with Go Daddy, I switched to what they sold as a VPS. I design exclusively with WordPress and an issue occurred on my new hosting plan because I followed the direction of one of Go Daddy’s senior level support agents. I couldn’t edit any of my sites as a result and they informed me WordPress is outside of their support parameters, BUT for a fee, I could open a paid support ticket. They couldn’t tell me what it would cost either. I was furious and soon also found out I didn’t really have a VPS, even though I was told I had one and I was paying for a VPS. Turned out it was shared hosting with enhanced resources. That’s when I decided enough was enough and found InMotion Hosting. I could go on all day about InMotion Hosting’s products and support, but suffice it to say that after comparing all the hosting providers out there, InMotion was the best choice on paper, so I migrated all my sites (nearly 50) to InMotion with much skepticism. That was a year ago and I have to say that moving to InMotion was the best decision of that year. Their resources are amazing and their support is even more amazing. Their technical staff is the most knowledgeable group of people I have ever spoken with. They fully support WordPress and they have never given me incorrect information, something that Go Daddy did about 50% of the time. My hosting plan has more resources, including free SSL’s and free business email for less than I was paying with Go Daddy. I also had to pay for SSL’s and business email with Go Daddy. I have experienced the worst in hosting with Go Daddy and now I enjoy the absolute best in hosting with InMotion Hosting. Save yourself some pain and frustration and learn from my mistakes. If you’re a freelancer, like me, with a growing business, do yourself a favor. If you want the best support on the planet and real VPS products, go with InMotion Hosting. You won’t regret it."
"Had 23 websites including emails up and running for one year. Suddenly, the server went down and they said it was a fsck issue, they lost all my data and emails and had no security backup. They apologised for the inconvenience and said it was impossible to recover the data ... Worst service EVER"
"I used inmotion hosting for a number of years, and they charged me for services I never used. When I pointed this out to them once I figured it out, they refused to refund any $$$. I also had problems with them throughout my tenure and their customer service was less than helpful. They have no concern for your satisfaction as a customer. Finally moved it all out to another."
"I've used Inmotion for a number of years and have experienced a number of issues. The CPU usage is maxed out in no time, security on the server has been an issue with costly remedies and my websites have been down because of an ongoing issue with tokens. The most recent problem however relates to an expired credit card. Though I renewed with amended details Inmotion failed to take any payment and consequently my domains registered could no longer be used. However, to use my two domain names again they were going to charge me $200+ as a penalty. I'm moving all my other websites to another server after many years and thousands of dollars spent with Inmotion."
"love inmotion's live phone tech support when an expert who knows what they are doing answers. But when someone who doesn't know what they are doing, or doesn't want to help answers, problems go indefinitely :-( Hope one day they can be more consistent with their hiring & training practices, before they allow a person to answer support calls. What would have been a 5 star review, has to go down to a 1 star on security and lack of resolution. Their backups fail multiple times. When their servers go down, their backups do not restore data. If combined sites have more than 10 gig (with emails), then ALL BACKUPS FAIL :-( Thankfully i have a security system to delete malware that keeps popping up on inmotion shared server hosted sites, but it's awful that they don't offer a way to find out how someone is able to hack into their servers and place these into the sites over and over again. I even deleted wordpress and all plugins and put a simple text/php site and still had to cleanup malware on one site ;-( When calling support, they simply want you to pay $300 a year per site to sucuri to try to find why inmotion is not able to provide secure websites as promised on their front page? Frustrated, since I don't want the hassle of moving all files and websites somewhere else and LOVE inmotion's live tech support. I've used some sites with chat support and found them to be a huge waste of time to resolve simple problems."
"My experience is definitely better than some of the reports below. I'm signed onto a VPS tier and have experienced zero downtime, and on my big sites, far better speed than I was getting on Siteground. (Consequently half of my five SG 'GoGeek' accounts have been migrated to InMotion and the rest will follow by middle of this year - I can put them all in one account!) One of the benefits of the VPS is that I can now assign clients their own cPanel.

Of course, this makes me a hosting engineer, not a consumer of midgrade hosting. But I get to charge for that, ie, collect rent."
"I have had a dedicated VPS-based website with InMotion for 5 years and have nothing but praise for them. Before that I suffered through slow, wonky web hosts that just couldn't handle the traffic and/or technical requirements that I needed. Once I found InMotion, I never looked back.

I have found their uptime and speeds to be fantastic. In the past, with other web hosts, I didn't find that to be true. And those are critical issues to me. Their support department has been excellent. 24/7 coverage by chat or email. Every time that I've had to use them they have been prompt and helpful.

Now I have seen some of the other reviews complaining about speeds with InMotion and all I have to say is that this is a common problem with shared plans. It's a matter of balance and all you need is one resource-greedy website on a shared server to slow everything on that server down. And it's a dynamic problem that can't be planned for. For instance, someone doing a huge download from the web host during prime time hours will kill your website. So if it's critical to have website performance, then you'll need to pay for a semi-dedicated or dedicated plan. There aren't any free/cheap rides out there and there are compromises to everything.

All that being said, I am extremely happy with InMotion and don't plan on going anywhere!"
"I am a VPS-1000 Reseller with InMotion for almost a year. After creating wordpress websites for customers in GoDaddy, BlueHost and Network Solutions I needed to bring the hosting under one umbrella because cPanel is not available at NetworkSolutions(!) and costs extra with some hosts. Same for SSL certificates. Being a one man shop, it's hard to be an expert in web world but I dig in and try first knowing I may get stuck... so excellent 24/7 tech support was critical in my decision - which I researched extensively. Obviously by my review title, I recommend InMotion without reservation. My VPS-1000 plan is affordable, cPanel (& Softaculous), AMP and WHM have me flying through tasks I never thought I'd master much less understand. Their tech staff is 2nd to none. They've helped me through the dumb questions and highly technical challenges. Wait time is very reasonable (often less than 2-3 minutes) and the chat summary is automatically emailed for review and links. To round out my happiness are blazing fast websites with minimal TTFB. I could go on but need to run. Do yourself a favor and check out InMotion. You'll be happy you did."
"In the beginning they were great. Now our sites can only be accessed via cellular service. First was told by one of the rudest technical support specialists we needed to upgrade to a more expensive plan. (After at least 4 yrs why?). Then told by another one that piped sunshine that was wrong and our ip's had all been blacklisted? Again after 4 years why? Last one said it looks like a plugin, but let me turn this off and it will work. It did for a few hours. Today, we are waiting well over 30 mins to get another theory before we switch to another web host. The bigger they get the worse they are. They don't seem to care and have ppl working technical support that have no clue as to anything other than to say your customers have been blacklisted due to too many failed logins. Um negative, they don't login neither do we and we can't even access it. OVER THEM!!"
"I shifted to a VPS plan here, closing two siteground accounts because of a recent large price hike - and thereby I not only saved a lot of money but also got remarkably better speed. Plus, the access to WHM gives me so many more options to deal with matters that otherwise required a ticket on the SG GoGeek tier. Customer service has been fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about my InMotion experience. (I have four other accounts at SG...they are going to be ported over, too.)

If you are managing sites for multiple clients, you should be considering an InMotion VPS package."
"I recently recommended InMotionHosting's (WordPress Hosting - WP-2000s) to a few clients. I thought I was providing a superior product to what they previously were using (GoDaddy). Boy I was wrong. Front-end performance is so-so, but nothing exceptional. BUT where I was flabbergasted was their back-end performance.

I uploaded 11 images into WordPress. These images totaled 11.2 MB. It took over SEVEN minutes to upload those 11 images. The CPU usage in cPanel was maxed out. So while I was waiting for these to upload, I went to my personal website, logged-in, and uploaded the same 11 images in less than 60 seconds. (I'm using A2Hosting on a mid-level plan that is comparable ""on paper"" to the InMotionHosting WP2000s plan).

I reached out to InMotionHosting support and in summary was told that ""Speeds Vary"" on the backend. Which translates ""Sorry, You're Out of Luck, so pay 4 times as much for our VPS hosting"".

I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
I think Inmotion EPITOMIZES professionalism in all aspects of their services. I usually have to contact tech support for various issues on my site and they could not be better in addressing and resolving these issues. My only challenge is their verification process and I change my PW from time to time and sometimes I forget to save the new one and then have to go through the reset process before they will help me and hey it's not their fault but it is frustrating. I have been with them for ten years and will stay with them forever
"I don't understand the negative reviews for inmotionhosting. I've been through three or four hosts and inmotion hosting is by far the best. I've got a shared and a vps account hosted. My primary metric is support. You log into your customer portal, click on chat and unless there's some major outage going on, you've got a capable tech on the line within minutes. Very few things need to be escalated so your issues are solved extremely quickly. I've had them migrate a vps server (CENTOS upgrade...done within 18 hours of request) and rebuild a firewall (done within 2 minutes of initiating the chat) in the last week. I have no idea how pricey they are because my time is much more valuable than any incremental monthly hosting cost. When they can solve a down time issue within minutes, that's worth hundreds to me. Buy with confidence."
"I am not a tech guy and paid a previous company to convert my website to Wordpress (PHP) platform. When I signed up for Inmotion Hosting back in January, they said everything was transferred correctly. My site came up, so I was good. I didn't need to change my website until March 2020. By then, I couldn't retrieve my .php website from my previous hosting company. Inmotion didn't transfer my .php wordsite over to their platform, but uploaded my .html website (non-Wordpress site), so I couldn't access my website in Wordpress Dashboard any more. I hired a web designer spending $130 to see what the problem was. They found the files but said they were .php.bin files and Inmotion would need to be saved in the proper format for them to access the correct files and upload the correct website. I've found Inmotion chat staff to be incompetent. Calling support is not much better. Have to wait on hold over an hour, then spend another 1 1/2 hours on the phone for them to try to fix it only to be told they'll have to escalate it to higher up people. It's been three days and no response. I am a small business and this kind of service/support is unacceptable for their mistakes. They also try to weasel their way out of responsibility when on the support chat or phone with them for their mistakes."
"I transferred my work website to In Motion Hosting because they are in the USA. I am an inexperienced web developer and every stumbling block I came across, In Motion had a well defined How To page. They have assisted in web transfer, set up of new site on WordPress, and more. I am still in the learning phase of WordPress but have had a feeling of security with In Motion having my back.

In Motion chat is the best. They answer quickly and stay with you as they help you work out any problems you may have. They also follow up to make certain that you are satisfied with their resolution. I am very pleased to be working with such professionals!"
"Inmotion is pretty good and I couldn't agree more with the comments already here. One thing about the article you need to update: they no longer provide free backups. It's now paid. Customer support: uhmmm I'd say 50/50. (But 90% of the time good). Sometimes good, other times bad. In some cases they don't seem to know what they're doing and even though they have a good customer response time, they sometimes don't do things just right. And are quick to tell you to get a developer when clearly the Person attending to you have no idea whatsoever he was paid to do. Server uptime: lately I'm not impressed. Even though Inmotion deserves 5 stars in my heart, I'm taking two stars out until they change. Because they have a great team of customer personnel, they sometimes forget the customer is always right. I recommend this platform though"
You can have a serious project. InMotion will support it very well. If customer service is like lightning.

I contracted my IT person to remedy the situation and, after two visits, it was determined that it was, indeed, InMotionHosting's fault. I re-contacted them and was told that, although their tech was mistaken, they would not pay my IT company's invoice because they hadn't told me to contract a third party. The ""supervisor"", Seth, was a condescending pissant who basically told me this whole thing was MY fault and refused to accept ANY culpability. With the number of reputable web hosting companies available I have no idea why someone would do business with these people unless, like me, they were already locked into a contract.

10 GB storing space. We are a paying customer, and we expected that our data would be properly secured from harware failures. However our experience with Inmotion Hosting has proved this not to be true. We have lost valuable information related to our customers, goverment agencies and banking regulators.
I believe that it is irresponable for a company to offer a service so sentitive to business' such as emails services, and not anticipate making a copy of their own servers content.
Moreover, if you want to have a backup copy of your information, you have to doit yourself with the tool they provide for this purpose. If we are payng customers, why would we have to do this ourselves?
Be carefull when you choose this hosting provider, because your data my be completely lost if you trust Inmotion Hosting to take care of storing it.

he vast majority of the time, the First Tier people want to be helpful, they are knowledgeable, and when they don't have an immediate answer they will do their best to get one from their higher tier technicians. The rare times I've had a problem that I knew was not caused by my own coding, I've been very pleased with their response time and their willingness to help. I've been with them since 2013 and I can recall only one time where the person blamed it on my code immediately without bothering to do any research. Of course it turned out that it **wasn't** my code -- it was a glitch in an htaccess file that was apparently caused by CPanel. I never touch htaccess so I knew it wasn't something that I'd done. The second person I talked with was much more helpful and he troubleshooted the file, told me the problem, and he fixed it himself. That is awesome service!

but nothing exceptional. BUT where I was flabbergasted was their back-end performance.
I went upload 11 images into WordPress. These images totaled 11.2 MB. It took over SEVEN minutes to upload those 11 images. The CPU usage in cPanel was maxed out. So while I was waiting for these to upload, I went to my personal website, logged-in, and uploaded the same 11 images in less than 60 seconds. (I'm using A2Hosting on a mid-level plan that is comparable ""on paper"" to the InMotionHosting WP2000s plan).
I reached out to InMotionHosting support and in summary was told that ""Speeds Vary"" on the backend. Which translates ""Sorry, You're Out of Luck, so pay 4 times as much for our VPS hosting"".

Best cms ever. We are using nop from 3.2 version and every version is getting better. Fast and Professional cms
Best cms ever. We are using nop from 2.8 version and every version is getting better. Fast and Professional cms
This platform is very fast and flexible.
NopCommernce is good platform but plugins are costly as compare to open source platforms. So enhancements most of the time become costly.
"Nopcommerce may be a good platform. It is not free. To download and install is free. However, you must display a powered by NopCommerce link on every page in the same format and style you would place emphasis with your store and content listings. 
We learned that customers are more reluctant to purchase from a store that can be opened and created by a third party vendor from Russia. The PCI Compliance is not necessarily out of box. Our PCI Compliance with this product is less than secure and we have had to make many fixes to correct the constant errors with this platform. The site crashes whenever Windows performs an update since the product is best hosted on Windows Server. Between the buggy software and expensive plugins, we have learned the hard way about the expense Nopcommerce does not offer for a steady online business. Many glitches and very buggy. Your customers will not refresh the page just to check out when the bugs randomly occur. The error logs associated with Nopcommerce do not represent the true errors when your site is experiences issues. Therefore, regular testing is a must, I mean at least twice a week.

We have spent thousands of dollars with Nopcommerce and Nopcommerce vendors. They lack support! Every time there is an issue we never get a response. Even though we have purchased annual support packages, they either ignore the simple response or do not have an answer. We manage to fix every problem they have without their continued annual support. Thing is, when you are an online business and you rely on a platform such as Nopcommerce, when you purchase annual support plans with your plugin and themes and spend thousands of dollars every year just to have the insurance the product will function, don't trust Nopcommerce to follow up with any support request. 
Go with a more stable open source product that is not so much as concerned with funding and more on a open source product that maintains performance and stability. This product is very buggy."
"Well-structured and stable platform. We’ve been working with it for a few years already. I can compare: before that, our company made the projects on a well-known PHP platform, and when developing a relatively complex store, we always faced performance and customization issues because of the platform’s bulky architecture. As a result, both our clients and we were unhappy. We were looking for a replacement option for a long time, then finally chose nopCommerce, and have no regrets about it. 

The previous review amused me a lot, by the way. If someone can’t set up server updates properly, without crashing the site’s work, since when it is a problem of the platform, and not a particular worker? We have no such problems with our sites. The same for bugs. Actually, it’s very frustrating when inexperienced developers start to blame everyone except themselves, especially when they start writing negative things about really great and also free, open-source projects with a huge community around the world like nopCommerce."
"Very well designed eCommerce platform.

If you have a dotnet background then you will find this very easy to understand the code, and to work with and extend.

I would say it is an excellent choice for someone with a technical background who is comfortable developing and deploying dotnet websites.

This gives you a very nice framework as a starting point to build a comprehensive ecom platform on top of.

Being honest, if you are not a proficient dotnet developer then you might struggle because the documentation and forums are not the best; they are littered with unanswered posts from people with little technical expertise who are attempting to develop and maintain their own website.

If this is you then you may be better working with a partner or looking for a fully hosted platform like shopify."
"No brain melting features, but all in all, a very handy plugin that does exactly what it promises without any bulk. Highly recommended for anyone with a local business, or web designers/SEOs with local clients."
"The Local SEO Plugin makes creating geo sitemaps and KML files a breeze. (It’s actually a plain sitemap they include in the index sitemap from the core SEO plugin that links straight to the KML file, since Google no longer supports Geo extensions in the Sitemap protocol). It also allows easy embedding of schema.org annotated info into your pages.

If you’re tech-savvy, or know someone who is, you can implement everything that Yoast’s local plugin does. However, it’s probably going to cost you a lot more and it’s likely there will be mistakes (schema implementation, etc)."
"Pros
 - robust seo analysis
 - useful newsletter
 - breadcrumbs feature
 - option to use free version
 - preview and easy to edit meta description and title of posts / pages
 - possibility to mark cornerstone content

Cons
 - some issues with sitemap and support perhaps got confused because of extensive e-mail communication involved.
- a bit more flexible would be nice
- for some it can be price but there is still free version too

I had an experience with one of their competitors plugin and first flaw was that it didnt come with support of my native language so on-page seo analysis was hence useless. This is NOT a problem with YOAST as it does support vast number of languages so I can definitelly RECOMMEND this product"
"Poor business practices.

Gave the test run of the premium subscription plan, failed to cancel it on time (my mistake), received the email describing to support that I had moved from Wordpress. Received an email back basically describing that they'd support me up until the end of my subscription but wouldn't be refunding me money.

Literally costs you nothing to be like this Yoast. Not my cup of tea, will steer clear in future.

EDIT: Don't let the ""reached out"" fool you, my money hasn't been refunded."
"Its a simple but hyped SEO plugin. It has been providing very generic features for a long time now. Needs to include a few more features like rich snippet support, keyword research, and competitor analysis. Maybe it isn't possible with a plugin but some kind of extended solution can help (ex. SaaS)"
"Yoast helped me to make my first affiliate income online. It's simple and easy to follow guidelines help you to write content that works with search engines. All you need to know is your keyword, which you input in the plugin (which shows up when creating your blog post). Once you do that, it tells you what you are missing and what you need to add. It lets you know if you overoptimize (which isn't good), and how to fix it. It also reminds you to add the proper image data, which I almost always forget to do. Definitely use Yoast, whether you have a ton of SEO knowledge or none. Occasionally some of the functionality of the plugin doesn't work. It will tell you that you have 3 sentences that start with the same word (so you should fix that). You should be able to click it, and it highlights the sentences in question. However, it doesn't always work for me, and I keep everything updated. It's an excellent tool that keeps you optimized. This alone won't get you to the front of Google (off site SEO is more important for that), but this is the foundation of good SEO on your site."
"Yoast is one of my favorite tools on earth. As a WordPress blogger and SEO, I can't imagine what life would be like without Yoast. I compare it to &quot;Grammarly for SEO.&quot; As you are crafting blog posts and moving about your WordPress dashboard, Yoast will give you tips and tricks to improve your organic search optimization. Yoast tells you if you're using your target keyword in a post often enough, it tells you if the voice of the piece is too passive, it allows you to change and optimize your titles and meta descriptions, with suggestions on how to do so. Seriously, it does everything. I would never run a blog that has an SEO focus without it. In my opinion, it's a perfect tool. And not too expensive. None 5/5"

"They are affordable, easy to set up and easy to manage. Their customer support is great, but sometimes it might take 15+ minutes to get in touch with them. Hopefully they’ll be even better in the future"
"I’m in the online industry since 2010. I started with just one site, and now I own several properties with different business models.I’ve been with HostGator from the beginning of my online journey, with a Baby Plan (shared server).

For the first 2/3 years everything went smooth, but during my 4th year I’ve been experiencing a lot of account suspensions, due to excessive use of server resources (I think mostly for a big increase of traffic – around 50k monthly).

After a few months of up and down, with many optimization attempts on my sites, I decided it was time to upgrade.

I switched directly to a dedicated server (since more than one year already). UpTime is 99,9% (last incident alert refers more than 5 months ago – just a few minutes of downtime).

The server response is awesome and the loading time of my sites is amazing. I’m really happy with the customer service, they have always helped me with a quick assistance.

In overall, I’m very satisfied with HostGator. I definitely suggest it to my friends."
"My experience with HostGator has not been great. They used to be fine in my early days with them but suddenly they started to have a lot of downtimes. Since my site was growing, I thought upgrading to a dedicated server will improve things: I upgraded to a dedicated server with them but this did not change anything. I eventually had to cancel my hosting with them.

To date, they still send me emails trying to bill me for “my” dedicated server that has been canceled long ago. In short, they have deteroriated in a long time and I will recommend avoiding them."
"I’ve had quite a few issues with HostGator recently, in all cases the wait time for support has been at least 5-10 minutes and in most cases their front line representatives haven’t been able to solve the issue. That means they need to escalate it to tier two support and the waiting time for that has been two days – five days.

In some cases they still weren’t able to get the issue resolved and I had to pay for external support. Really regret choosing them for my webhost and will be making a change at sometime in the future. Don’t fall for all the advertisements."
"I’ve been using HostGator for few years, they are “decent”, but the main problem lies on their customer support. I don’t know if they are overselling their products/services, but it sometimes can take an hour or more to get in touch with them via live chat. This is too much, I think…"
"We have a client on hostgator who cannot send email to some of their most important clients because the nameservers are on several blacklists. We use the non-SSL ports to go out to remedy this solution, but it is exposing us to other problems. The webmail sends via their SSL nameservers by default which renders it useless. I have spoken to support but they are not planning on fixing the problem. We have to move, they give us no other option. I cannot recommend them for email. And if you are looking for support, be ready to wait 30 minutes."
"A lot of people are afraid of budget hosting for a variety of reasons. Most of them have to do with the support you will receive, the safety of your sites on their shared hosting, etc. I was with hostgator for nearly a decade and only had an issue with getting a refund from them after cancelling hosting.

Their small plans ran me $8 a month and I could host unlimited sites and have unlimited bandwidth/storage on a cPanel interface. Definitely great for those who are trying to break through in design, or who just want to have a few different projects for fun."
"I’ve been with HostGator for roughly 5 years. When I first started out with them everything worked great, I like that they use cPanel and that I was able to add multiple domains to one account for a very attractive monthly rate.

The first 3 years went without any problems. My websites loaded quickly and had minimal to no downtime.

Then in year 4 I started having problems with my website loading slowly, HostGator blamed it on the fact that I was taking up to many resources. I tweaked a few things on my WordPress installations, especially on the one for my most popular website. After those adjustments I was fine for a little bit, but eventually it happened again… This time I went through my records and pointed to multiple times my website went down, they did blame it on my websites again. But after I pushed the issue I think they conceded that my websites weren’t the problem. I was notified that my website was being moved to another server and that I may experience brief downtime. I was okay with this as it meant something was really being done about some of the problems I had.

Now I am in year 5 and am again a very happy customer. All of my websites are working as they should, I have not experienced any downtime, as far as I’m aware. So all in all I’ve been happy with my HostGator experience, except for the fact that maybe they could’ve delved into my problems with them a little more thoroughly the first time I experienced significant downtime. But they’ve made it right and I didn’t suffer from it too much."
"We have a few websites hosted by HostGator. The sites are business pages and receive a low amount of targeted traffic from Google AdWords, and we do not need an extensive amount of hosting services. Generally, we want low downtime, quick contact with support when we have questions, and the ability to run our email servers through the hosted sites.

HostGator manages this perfectly. We’ve never had issues with our sites being offline or with email failing, and in the few instances when we have needed to contact support, I was impressed by how quickly we were able to get in touch with a representative and get the situation sorted.

We admittedly have low requirements for a web-hosting company, but our experience with HostGator has always been satisfactory and low-stress, allowing us to focus on running our businesses."
"When I first began using shared Hostgator services back years ago – it was the best bang-for-the-buck that you could get. Since then, it was slowly degraded into crowded servers, poor performance, and lack-luster customer support.

The once coveted sub-$10/month web hosting deal has since been invaded by other providers offering better performance and support; leaving Hostgator behind."
"I signed up for HostGator in July 2013 after participating in a twitter chat with bloggers who PRAISED HostGator.

I had come to a point where I wanted my blog to stop looking generic, I found someone who would design for free and I bought my domain. It seemed like the perfect time to use a hosting site and in the beginning HostGator was incredible. They walked me through everything. I am not techy and the gentleman from customer service showed me each step of transitioning my site from WordPress.

Fast forward to March 2016 where honestly I’m not using my blog the way I used to and it took THREE tries to get a customer service representative to chat with me via computer. The wait was around 10 minutes. I was out of practice and could not even really recall why I even had hosting so I had a lot of questions for my customer service representative since my $100+ 3 year renewal will need to be made in July again.

I’m still a little foggy as to why I should use HostGator again at such a steep price tag. Once my hosting was set up I never really utilized their services and it seemed like a pain to have to wait so long for a customer service rep. Not a major complaint, just an observation. Considering switching to GoDaddy if it’s cheaper/has speedier customer service. I wanted to cancel my auto renewal with HostGator but none of the customer service representatives would inform me of how to since my plan still has a few months. I finally just deleted my credit card information on the profile.

Hopefully that works and I can make an educated decision come July.."
"HostGator has terrible customer service and tends to be fairly slow getting new accounts set up. Getting in touch with support is a waste of time, and usually they can’t help anyway.

That said, you get what you pay for. If you are trying to save money, HostGator is cheap and relatively easy to figure out.

So it all depends on your needs. If you have one or two WordPress or static sites to host, HostGator is slightly better than average. Any more than that and you should probably start looking somewhere else."
Have been using them for close to 5 years now to host a large vBulletin forum and several smaller sites and the service and support has been excellent. Any issues we’ve had – a few relating to PHP version on startup were quickly and efficiently resolved. From a sever admin perspective as the admin it’s pretty much been hands off and the same for billing. It just works. Can’t say enough good about them.
"I was with HostGator for about 3 years. In that time we had multiple down times. Some of which lasted more than 2 days. We would try to contact them with no luck, often having to resort to Tweeting them in order to get their attention. It was a nightmare. When they were fully functional my website was fast I had no issues and was always able to manage my own servers effectively.

Unfortunately, the downtimes caused us to lose customers and I was forced to move to a different provider entirely."
"Customer service was GREAT… Then I got a phone call from a representative talking to me about the benefits of upgrading. One of the perks was free website migration that took up to 3 days. I like that idea so I upgraded.

Over the next 2 weeks I contacted customer service looking for an update on the migration. I finally got a response the third time that it would take 4-6 weeks! So they lied and did not update me that they were “under a heavy workload”. So they lied to me about migration time. Then the rep said he was sorry that “I misunderstood the terms and conditions”. Here we are 5 weeks in… They still have not migrated my data."
"Hostgator is a pretty solid host I used to use. When they say they have 24/7 support, they mean it. I had a problem once at around 5AM and they were still online to help me out! But their uptime isn’t the best.. It’s up most of the time but there’s those 2 or 3 hours of the week that their offline for maintenance. But otherwise their pretty good in that sense.

When it comes to the cPanel, it’s like any other. It has all the features any other cPanel host would have, and not as glitchy as some others that I used. When it comes to their plans, they are very cheap for what they give. For $5.95 you can add unlimited domains. But remember, you need to buy a domain and that plan, not just the plan will give you unlimited domains. I recommend buying the domains from their website since it’s very cheap @ $5.99/year for the first year then it can raise up to $14.99.

Overall, I would give Hostgator a solid 90/100 rating!"
"Had ongoing problems with HostGator with them constantly locking down my site due to “CPU usage” being too high and then the only fix they would offer would be for me to upgrade to more expensive plans or dedicated server… basically setting me up to fail so I would have to upgrade at considerably greater cost.

Also, their support is rubbish… extensive wait times for chat, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes and that’s if it would connect at all. Phone support was worse, over an hour was not unusual, and raising a ticket just meant days of waiting. All the while my site would be down, my audience drifting away and my desperation growing…

Go with a smaller company that actually wants and appreciates your business!"
"They offer some good, cheap plans, but if you care at all about up time or reliability you might want to look elsewhere. When it is up, it’s a good service, but usually when it goes down, it’s down for long stretches (sometimes days)."
"It has it’s downsides sometimes depending what kind of actions you expect from it. It can get slow at times, and somewhat confusing, not really that much of a deal, perhaps better for more casual sites. The customer service is just alright, not too bad. Can seem over-pricey but good in the long-run."
"This was my very first hosting provider that I used.

The good:

Super easy to use. User-friendly interface. Competitive prices etc… I’d say it’s perfect for beginners.

The bad:

Since I forgot to update my WordPress website, it got hacked and redirected to some Chines and Russian pages. After contacting HostgGator, they tried to sell me a tool that would ‘prevent’ this from happening. But no help on recovering my current site, so I manually had to upload a backup to keep it up.

Fast forward few months, I moved out from HostGator and bought more expensive hosting package from somewhere else.

It’s not always about the cost, sometimes you need to pay more so the hosting company would truly ‘care’ about you."
"I’ve been using HostGator for the past 1 year, and you believe or not, my uptime so far is 99.99%, yeah its true. In fact, I have seen many people complaining that HG is worst company. But I personally found them good at cheap rates. The bad thing I found is they charge extra charges for activating SSL.

Overall, its great company. Will recommend without any doubt."
"I am a customer at HostGator for more than 8 years, I always been a loyal customer because they have been the most excellent hosting provider I dealt with for 7 years, but since about 14 months they started going down and down very fast, the technical support responsiveness is almost equal to 0, days and weeks will pass before they respond to my ticket, and some tickets will never get any response!

The 45 days money back grantee is a big lie, when you buy a new hosting they will charge your card and then will send you a greeting email, then immediately will terminate your account and send you an email requesting you to verify your identity, you will have to send them a scan for your credit card and a scan for your identity that was issued by government, and after that they will not unsuspend your account and will not pay back your money and will not answer any ticket for you!"
"I used to host multiple sites on HostGator but after they got sold to EIG, their performance has been reduced. It takes almost 30-45 minutes to get connected to thier support department at live chat. Plans at HostGator are very costly. Final verdict: Unhappy with HostGator and has moved almost all sites from them.

There are better alternatives out there…"
"When I started out with Hostgator about 2 years ago, their service and performance weren’t fantastic but definitely adequate for my needs. However within the last year their service has been absolutely terrible. They have incredibly slow response time or no response at all.

About four days ago they suspended one of my sites. I resolved all issues requested by the immediately. 4 days later there has been no response at all. Therefore I moved all my sites to a new host. Hostgator should be avoided as they will suspend sites without anyway to get them reinstated within a reasonable time frame. In fact, I would say Hostgator is probably a bigger threat to your site being taken down due to their terrible service rather than outside hacks."
We are using their shared hosting plan on our websites and also on client websites. The great concern with hostgator is their slow page load time so we are thinking to move our sites to their new cloud hosting or business hosting plan or will go with other hosting alternatives.
"The most annoying thing about Go Daddy was they kept calling me to purchase more. The problem with Hostgator is they don’t listen to you.

I have contacted hostgator 4 times by email and 1 phone call to NOT renew my domain. They don’t freaking get it! I even changed my billing to not be automatically renewed and they did it anyway. I was still charged for a domain I originally canceled last November! (It’s July now) They don’t listen to you, so why bother to contact customers when you are going to ignore them anyway? Every email they sent telling me to renew my domain I replied that the account (my customer) was canceled. They emailed me telling me my billing had changed and to update it. I told them I changed it to not be automatically billed for a canceled account. After 4 emails and a phone call they ignored everything and billed me for the domain name. Now I have to go to my Credit Card bank to dispute it. I recommend you use anyone else but Hostgator."
"I started using Hostgator in around 2008 at a time when they used to be truly excellent. They have since horribly declined in reliability, particularly when it comes to customer support (which for me, is THE most important element of good hosting).

Hostgator used to operate a ticketing system for support, alongside a US telephone number and online chat. Over the years the length of time it took to get a response via online chat and email ticketing increased substantially. As a UK business I couldn’t call the US number without incurring a huge telephone bill, so chat and email ticketing were the only option.

Early in 2016 Hostgator cancelled the email ticketing system, which was a massive backward step. Now, the only way to contact support is via online chat. This might not sound like a problem, but it can take up to an hour to be connected, and 90% of the time I found that nothing happened – I simply wasn’t connected and had to start the session again, which was infuriating. It didn’t matter which PC, ISP or browser I used, the vast majority of the time I needed chat support I was never connectedt. I was therefore left in a position where I was hosting 50+ websites (many critical business sites and busy shops) and had no way of contacting support.

Despite the decline in support options and the increase in support time-frames, Hostgator then decided to increase my monthly bill by $5 – it might not sound like much, but I wasn’t given a choice and the increase made the package I had uncompetitive (especially as there are now cheaper alternatives that make use of higher quality and faster SSD cloud storage (both reseller and VPS).

Hostgator are currently surviving off outdated 4 and 5 star reviews from a time when they used to offer quick helpful support and reasonably priced hosting packages. They are no longer reasonably priced, and their support is terrible."
"Between phone and chat box have spent over 3 hours working to get a full refund for a domain I never ordered. There customer service is terrible, always needing to find a senior agent, that is never there."
"I have been with HostGator for about three years and I have to say that they usually fix the problems but the process is very cumbersome. If I call them with a service issue it always takes about 10-15 minutes to get to support. If I call with a new service request or sales department the connection is instant. This is very concerning, they are obviously pro-growth but at the same time I really don’t want to do business with them anymore. I am writing this while I am holding to get my website back up, which was hacked and down for two weeks. I cannot get any satisfaction from the online support chat, or creating a trouble ticket and waiting days for a response to only find out that they need more information and more time to respond. If it was easy to switch back to my original web hosting I would, but it seems like I’m stuck.

My advise is to not choose a webhosting based on ranking because at the time I signed up HostGator was among the top, and then they were sold to another company. Choose a hosting company for how long they have been providing great service to the clients, now how fast they have grown. I am very unsatisfied with HostGator."
"1- Websites slow.

2- Terrible, terrible support. Every issue, even simple ones, took 4-5 back and forth tickets to solve, minimum. On the phone, it’s usually 40 minutes of waiting + 30 minutes with a clueless rep.

3- Cancelling was a pain in the neck. They required me to call a salesman three separate times. Had to cancel hosting, then dedicated IP address, then SSL. They wouldn’t just “cancel everything”.

Worst hosting experience I ever had. Stay away."
"Horrible experience with them….

Email unable to send out from their server. After calling them on a Monday, I need to call them on a Wednesday and Friday on the same issue and ticket number again. Issue was not resolved at all, they kept saying will delegate to the admin team to check on server. Issue not resolved and no update from anyone on the issues.

Horrible! At this digital age now, if we can do without email, there is no need for any hosting!"
This company is comprised of thieves. My website was wrongfully accused of being hacked and then my hosting plan was suspended. This was just after my 3 year contract had been renewed. They called and sent a bunch of emails to try to sell me some bull**** SiteLock service which I didn’t need. I had enough and decided to switch hosting companies. After that I sent in a request to terminate my plan and get a refund for the 2+ years which I would not be using. Now they are refusing to terminate my plan and will not send a refund. I am being overcharged 2+ years! This is insane. Stay away from this company if you don’t want to be robbed.
Today I removed all 6 hostings from hostagtor and I am so happppy. I hate this guys. The main reason is Support. 4 hours on chat 3 hours on phone and no answer. No matter when you call. You will not reach them. Stay away keep away. Don’t even think of creating account with them.
"After being a customer for over 5 years hostgator suspended my account as they said I use too much bandwidth. No warning, just shut down my business site. I cleaned up some of the files on my own hours ago, and they still have not responded to my ticket. Horrible customer service, and false adversting as unlimited sites. I only have 5 sites."
"My website is a bit long, so I needed a short domain that I can use on advertising material. Through GoDaddy the chosen domain was $70/yr and through HostGator it was only $30. Since all I need is a redirect to my current site (purchased through and hosted with GoDaddy) I figured I would save $40. That was my first mistake.

I tried to purchase the domain, and their system wouldn’t let me continue when I selected “Montana” as my state. Apparently we aren’t a state any longer. I ended up having to call customer support, wait 10 minutes, and listen to their heavy breathing as they set it up over the phone. I asked them to put in an auto-redirect to my existing site, they said no problem. This was on a Wednesday, by that evening nothing was happening, so I live chatted and got a story of 24-48 hours to propagate.

Thursday nothing was happening. No redirect, no notice that I owned the domain on their account management, nothing. I used their live chat, again another 10 minute wait and 20 minutes of chatting. They “fixed” the issue. Still no redirect and a story of 24-48 hours to propagate.

Friday came, and I still couldn’t see my info on their site. There was no redirect, and whois showed I owned the domain (which I couldn’t access). I live chatted once again, and they “fixed” the issue. I finally was able to see my domain on their site, and they said it would redirect. I said when will I see the redirect? They said 24-48 hours to propagate. I’m now over 72 hours from when I purchased the domain. I requested a refund and asked them to push the domain back into the registry so I can go somewhere else to purchase it.

Saturday, still nothing. Sunday, still nothing.

Monday, I called once again. Another 10 minutes on hold. Another 20 minute phone call. They said they would take care of it and were “sorry to see me go.” I told them their service is the worst I have ever seen. I check my credit card later that day and they have charged me $30 to renew my domain.

Tuesday, I call again. Another 10 minutes on hold and a 30 minute phone call (most of which is spent listening to hold music). They argue with me about being charged. They finally say they will refund my $30 but not the original $4 to purchase the domain, and they can’t push it back into the registry, but I can transfer it to another hosting company after 60 days. Now I have advertising material that points to a site that won’t work for 2 months. Great.

Now almost a week out, nothing has happened, and these clowns keep jerking me around. If there’s no credit to my account I’ll call my credit card and open a fraud case.

Avoid HostGator at all costs, they’re absolutely terrible."
"I have been using hostgator for almost 5 years now, and I am fairly satisfied. It’s all about ROI and based on cost I am paying for hosting, service is better than expected. Customer support needs to improve in terms of time it takes to talk to an agent but once connected the service provided is always helpful. Chat and email response is considerably slow. Overall a good value for money in my opinion. I am using HG VPS hosting, Domains and emails."
"I bought a domain name package for my blog. Eventually I decided to discontinue the blog and so I wanted to cancel. Yet lo and behold, they make it as hard as humanely possible for you to quit. Apart from having to actually call, it is very hard to find out how to cancel. When you finally do uncover that you have to live chat or call to cancel(there is no other method available), the live chat takes forever to load. It’s absolutely horrible. I’m going to warn all my friends and acquaintances not to use HostGator because of their terrible service."
"Hostgator’s tech support is simply awful. You get a junior “tech support” rep to look into the issue you’re having, who seems to be instructed to do everything he can NOT to transfer the call to someone higher up. My experience went like this: 3 hrs of excruciating wait time on the line with junior rep, kept telling him I understood if he couldn’t address the issue but to please pass it on to his supervisor; supervisor refused to get involved; 3 hrs later, junior rep said there’s nothing he could do so he’d have supervisor give a call back (never happened). In the meantime, our website was down… Currently working on transferring over to another host ASAP and hopefully Hostgator’s management will take a good look into these awful “service calls” and realize they’re on the right track to lose their customer base."
"Worst hosting company I have ever used, everything was going just fine until they sent us a ticket by 5:00 am Dubai time and said we will have to move to dedicated server, and for sure we didn’t see the message until 8:00 am when many of our customers called asking why site is down, So hostagtor didn’t wait even until we reply or even wake up

For sure i will have to move to dedicated server now because I have to, but for sure won’t continue with this bad company."
"* On the last day of expiry of my hostgator account, I hit complete backup button and i received an instant message of I will be able to download soon after an e-mail arriving at me. But that e mail didnt come to me within 24 hours. I couldnt log in because my contract was finished the day before and I couldnt download my complete backup.

* Their customer service makes you wait 7-20 minutes. This is so long.

* They issue your new bill before the next payment date altough you uncheck automatic reneval. It means, if you turn back to them again, they will say you owe them.

* 5 years ago I began with hostgator with 5,5 USD or sth similar but this year they charged me 12,5 usd for the same baby package (they changed its name i think)

* With wordpress, they install some crap without permission and you need to uninstall them.

I got rid of them and now I am very very happy with Inmotion hosting. They have SSD drives for all plans and cheaper. My websites are rocket fast now."
"I don’t know what is slower here: my site or the support. Everytime I have to open a ticket I know that I will have to wait for god knows how long until any issue is fixed.

Last time there was a hack that placecd a redirect in htaccess to some porn site. What I can say is that Hostgator made my readers see something else then bikes for an entire day.

And that is just one example. AWFUL support, horrible speed, crappy shared service. Don’t go into ito if you mean to grow your blog big eventually."
"I am sad for myself and Hostgator. I’ve tolerated them for many many years, and through their good times and bad times. I feel sorry for their customer support and admins, because their management are idiots. They also got inexperienced fools that come in without understanding their business, their customer base, and especially not their re-sellers, and they screw things up massively (such as server settings), and create truly dumb polices. Then the support, and admins are stuck with their stupid internal rules and are forced to just give clients the runaround since they really cannot do anything on many issues. Sometimes the resolve is obvious or their client request is clear on what the action is client wants done, but the HG chat person refuses to do it. Very sad.

In addition, they will strip features and services promised, do things without giving notice, and some times it seems like they purposely cause problems to see if they can upsell you to a dedicated server or other packages. Due to their extremely dumb polices their staff gets frustrated and are rude, pushy, and dismissive to clients on chat. You can NO LONGER OPEN A TROUBLE TICKET or complain; it is not possible for you to simply submit a request on a problem (via web portal or email or phone), and are forced to wait a long long long time on chat window, for any issue, for a rep to respond, and even then he/she will refuse to open a ticket, and many times simply is not able to help. For some reason, they do not want their problems logged any longer and open a support ticket as a forced last action. After you wait a long time to get chat, then you are forced to chat for 1 hour to 2 hours that lead to frustration and lack of action and sometimes lack of understanding, or games to make you give up asking. So, if your issue does not require immediate action, or it will take time on their side to work on it, you will be forced to wait to get chat and wait on chat. Unlike most other places, you are not able to simply submit a trouble/support ticket and go on with your busy day.

Oh, they NO LONGER have a fast easy quick install of softwares, and outsourced their Quickinstall and it now SUCKS. You will be bombarded with tons of advertisements, and the quickinstall does not work on so many browser versions, it is too much to list.

Oh, forgot to mention they will breach contract of resellers and market to your client base. Quickinstall by itself will market a ton of stuff to a reseller’s base without permission to do so, and the reseller will not get a cent of the large money made. They will also have their name showing on supposed white-branded, or no-branded, or generic branded site builders (such as on pic images), server domain info, in files within cpanel, cloud stuff, etc as a means to lead people back to them or simply because the people working at Hostgator do not understand their customer bases or don’t care.

There is a ton more problems at Hostgator and with Hostgator, but I don’t have time to write 3 more pages."
"Hostgator has been a terrible experience:

Speed in USA is ok with Cloud Business package, but Speed on any other continent is terrible. We have a load time of 2-3 secs in the USA for our 2 mb fully optimized webshop but over 10 seconds in Europe (UK).

Customer service tries to tell you to upgrade to a more expensive package to improve speed even when you contact them to tell them the last upgrade did not do anything. They will charge you for existing packages when you upgrade. So if you pay cloud business 3 years and upgrade to dedicated server you will pay and the old package and the new package no refunds given either since as for most services they offer the 45 day money back guarantee does not apply.. did you not read the small letters?

45 day money back guarantee does not apply for Dedicated server, ssl certificates, privacy protection nor domains. What does it apply to I wonder?

I wish I never got fooled into going with this company following the obviously purchased reviews of this company on hosting compare websites this company is a hoax which cost me lots of money, time and lost customers due to terrible speed and service."
"I was a big fan of Hostgator, until they started bandwidth saving activities (0.0.0.0/~username/ wont work anymore neither if you link to a element on the host) and because of that they have messed something else which I cant figure. I am unable to migrate WordPress sites to it and they are charging me first and then asking for 72 hours for migration help which I dont need. My databases are importing fine on other hosts but not on hostgator. Few months back it was working like a charm. Save your money and avoid the hassle. Go for a better hosting company, it will not only save time in the long run but will save you when you need saving, hostgator wont."
"I tried to use the service and cpanel, but was blocked due to duplicate payment. And after 3 months neither was capable to use my cpanel or see my website online. Started chat with a lot of people that just answer my questions with a book of QUESTIONS and Answers, answers was always the same with copy/paste. At the end using my chat the buttons was blocked and cannot ask more ANSWERS and use RATE and EXIT. VERY DISAPPOINTED with this company. Don’t believe advertise of these company. Alligators are they: eating confidence, your time and your money."
"They used to be good, back when I started in 2008. But on 12/24/2016 my sites were hacked and defaced. Instead of offering their own tech support, Hostgator now has a link that opens a SiteLock ad with 3 levels of service offered, starting with a $200 cleanup. When I clicked on that I was led to a “consultant” who said I instead needed to purchase a 6-month monitoring and malware cleaning service. Once the contract for that was signed, “Oh no, your sites will need in-person time, that will be an additional fee.” That was when I said “Stop. Wait.” My daughter had me cleaned up in 1/2 day. I called SiteLock, asked for a cancel and was told I’d have to pay $150 (50% of the remaining fee. Yeah that’s in the agreement that I that I signed in a moment of stress) for a service I did not need and did not want. I contacted Hostgator, and finally got to talk to someone, who said he could not find any evidence of his transaction in my site’s records. He talked to SiteLock, who of course refused to refund me. But he asked to close the ticket without addressing the two key issues: The bait-and-switch upselling of SiteLock, and Hostgator’s system failure to record these transactions originating from their site. Do not use!"
"I purchased my Cloud Business plan in October. I had intentions of a quick website setup. Shortly after I had unplanned eye surgery on both eyes, which delayed my plans an extra month. In November as I was trying to get my website up I ran into issue after issue. This being my first time in years to create a site I was a bit dusty, but not dead. After several frustrating tries, days, hours and what not I finally found they were upgrading hardware, changing, moving servers, etc. During this time only some or none of their services would work. Each time I would finally make headway, there would be an error with a save. I’m a night owl, apparently this isn’t a good thing as none of their servers ever seemed to be working at night. Here I am feeling as flustered as ever to find that the plan I initially paid for isn’t showing up in my services. I have learned the hard way, and will never forget, that being a beginner looking for a decent web hosting site for an ecommerce store and blog to sell both digital and physical goods, that the “unlimited bandwith” and “unlimited disk space” is a joke! How they get away with these radiculous terms is amazing. My site isn’t even close to where I need it to be as it rarely runs long enough so I can get it started before I encounter a new error. Each time I log in there is a different look, or I’m sent in a continuous circle on their website from the log in screen to my Cpanel and I’m unable to get anywhere. As a beginner this has been a terrible experience. I’ve made mistakes, but I’m unable to even learn from them as Hostgator has not been consistent in how any of their software works. The new and old integration is a mess! I read a review on PCmagazine which lead me to choose Hostgator. I almost went with another hosting plan and now regret not doing so. *The money is an issue, but it’s the frustration in not even receiving an email from them of their system issues, outages, downtimes, server problems, links with breaks etc. Hostgator has sharp teeth and they are in my pants. If you are wanting a smooth experience (regardless if you are new or not), and if being up front is important to you when making business deals–then look somewhere else. AGAIN, I’m not experienced, but what I purchased and what I was given are not what it seemed to be."
"It wasn’t until I started receiving calls from customers that I realized our website was down. After spending 86 minutes on the phone trying to get a straight answer from 3 different techs (the first-tier service is utterly useless) I finally received an email stating that our site had been taken down due to resource abuse. I don’t dispute there was a problem, and I don’t object to the action they took. The issue is that they DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO NOTIFY US. A warning would’ve been best (fix this in 24 hours or we shut it off) but the very least they could’ve done was send us an email to let us know! Absolutely unforgivable."
"I have only been with Hostgator for a week, and needed Customer Support for 2 things.

A password reset.

To get the completed website I have on my computer live and online.

The password reset button does not work for my work email for some reason. I went to chat support, and it was painful. They asked me for my email confirmation about 6 times… to check my spam about 6 times. It was about a 5 hour process because I would get replies every 8 minutes, but if I did not response in 2 minutes I got the “are you there?”

FINALLY got it fixed, so I figured I would ask about getting the website I have completed on my computer live. I asked if there was 1 click integration, and this was a mistake as I have totally confused the person I am chatting with to a point of no return.

So I, starting to finally lose my cool say “I don’t care, I apologize I am getting salty but this has been a crazy long process with you guys and I just want to know where to go to get the website put up. I don’t care how many clicks I just want to get it online.” The chat person comes back and says “sorry it took so long, but that was the fastest way to do the password reset.” HOLY MOTHER OF GOD ARE YOU SERIOUS. LETS MOVE ON FROM THE PASSWORD RESET AND JUST TELL ME HOW TO GET MY WEBSITE ONLINE. That was how I felt on the inside.

After condensing my emotions and writing to them, I have still not received an answer.

This is the worst customer service experience I have had in 31 years on this planet."
"Since being purchased by EIG, HostGator has become truly awful. The service is poor. Support is a joke. They won’t even let you create support tickets any more. When you do finally hear from them, they often don’t fix things and they are always making excuses. They will leave you hanging for a week or longer, even on a critical issue. Avoid them like the plague."
"I subscribed HG hosting a couple of months. Since last December I also subscribed for HG professional website builder. My complaint is not about the speed of server or something like this. My complaints are for the customer service.

I have contacted them for dozens of time asking to solve issues with the HG website builder. They unexipedly suspended my plan for website builder then issued new invoice for payment. Despite the fact that I had already paid for the service. I created tickets for issues and they even didn’t care about what I asked. Imagine, I kept on paying for the service subscription, but no service. Yet another, they told me that they must terminate the original addon and then they would launch for new subscription. 3 months website which I built would be gone. No other way. So I don’t know what to do. I want to sue them. Because I worked on my website for 3 months to customise and suddenly they said I need rebuild the site again. How it is even possible? I can’t access the HT professional site builder, although I paid for that."
"The support staff is unprofessional and ignorant about almost everything related to their services. They take hours/days to get back to you with no useful response. In my most recent interaction when I didn’t get a response for hours, I complained to a supervisor and followed up on my issue, he ended up blaming me for being impatient, told me that the agent was new, and never even tried to address my problem after that. lol. Yes it’s cheap for a reason. Stay away."
Uptime is not a good as advertised and they will make changes without notification that will cause your website to become unusable. The do maintenance during core business hours without notification. Change limits without notification. Change software and subscription support without notification. Then you’re scrambling to get your customer’s website back up. Do not recommend. Use Justhost or Amazon AWS.
"2 Words: Just Don’t.

Alright, where do we start? I have been using them for one month, started all great with awesome blogs and research, great hosting provider! Got a Business Cloud plan, all is good… They sold me Sitelock fix, for protection, there was an error and Sitlock called me and said it’s useless to have Sitelock fix, if it finds any error I may be charged $300-500 USD to fix it, or I can get a plan only for $170 a month.

CodeGuard backup, you need backups? Sold this useless thing for $52 that dose absolutely what I can do manually, only it doesn’t work! 5 GB for 1 year up to 10 websites. Took me 2 tickets and still has errors on restore and backup (does not work), I spent 3 phone calls.

SSL certificate, alright here is the fun part, I got 3 websites and I wanted 3 of them, after the first SSL certificate… I paid, 3 days nothing… I had to call them 3 times and each time they told me to wait… Then they said it’s because I have Sitelock on my website, and it was somehow blocking ect. Reality, they said it will take them 8 hours to fix it (In 3 days they figured out noone installed it, it was supposed to be installed within 4-8 hours), after it was installed I had to fix my website and Codeguard didn’t work…

Alright, they said I would get a free Toll Free number, never got it, after 3 calls, they opened a ticket and said no estimated time, something they will fix, but can’t say when, just wait. 30 Days so far nothing, no Toll free number.

After they charged my SSL, they figured out I had it for free on my account, so I got a credit, not a refund of $39,99 USD.

Now, I added few more domains, got 1 more SSL certificate, now it was more fun… 10 hours of phone calls in 2 days and 8-9 people from support involved…

I had a redirect from one domain to another, it was just a domain for redirect, but I wanted to make it a website, got an SSL, and paid another $39.99, they installed it over night, the next day may main website is not working… All my domains got some glitch and are redirected to a primary domain, without me doing anything with DNS. So I call HostGator and say that after install of SSL, somehow, I think because of redirect the SSL that you installed has damaged my other SSL on another domain…

They said no! It can’t be, 1st person didn’t really understand what is the issue, if website is not working, it’s not their issue… Second person said, there is no changes in DNS, oops no idea, need a higher level admin! I’ll put you on hold… 2.5 hours on hold no answer… I started on chat with support member, he sid it is not them! It is CloudFlare! I said, take the damn phone, I’m on hold for 2.5 hours… No solution…

I call again… On hold, it is CloudFalre! Its the only possible way… I said, guys, again after install of SSL, you damaged the other SSL… No, it can’t be.

F. IT, changed my name servers to Hostgator, calling again! Again, next day…. Same story, no solution, transfer, on hold, transfer! Admin almighty is here! It is your code, we are managing servers not the code… Contact the developer… I am the freaking developer, and there is no problem with the code… On hold, on hold, reading all tickets, its your code… Transfer to another highest level of IT (Finally someone who knows something), he checked everything, checked my code and finally, came to my solution, it was their SSL install that damaged my other website… Now 2 days, 2 mornings around 10 hours in total of phone calls and chats, around 8-9 people to figure out all kinds of stories to fix one thing that I told them in first 5 min, SSL was installed wrongly…

Finally, I got a sitelock on the website for one month, no total amount, they charged me for 36 months! Then I got refund and guess what? Lost around $20 CAD on conversion rates.

1 month, I have over 12 tickets and 3 of them are open and not resolved, for every dollar I gave them, I had to fight with unqualified tech support. People are working, laughing with each other, and punting you on hold when someone in the office is talking to them, typing on the keypad some other things wile you are explaining the issue to them.

Just stay away, I am looking for another host and HostGator is just useless waste of time and money. I am lucky my website is in development, it is just impossible to imagine the impact if I had customers there."
"Stay away people! Their support is terrible. I had 4 different conversations trying to fix a basic problem and the last one told me he couldn’t help because I don’t host with them. Well…. I don’t host with anyone else, I get invoices from them, I have an account that I can log into, and a whois says I am hosted with them. I was logged into my account at the time of this online chat, so I don’t know what he was talking about. Obviously just confused and frustrated that he isn’t trained and can’t help his customers. They were ok when I first signed up in 2012, but have gone significantly downhill since."
"We have been taken offline twice this month by hostgator. At the beginning of the month and at the end of the month. They said we were over our 25% server capacity, but we are a small business website. They then tried to upsale me $4,000 for a dedicated server. I was paying $19.99 and they wanted me to upgrade to $200 a month. When I talked at that, they said I needed to hire a WordPress professional, which I have been using WordPress for 7 years on several sites without problem. They happened to have one available for $49 dollars extra a month. So I can pay at least an extra $50 a month and have my website put back on or I will have to go back and forth with them. I am still not online. I was fine yesterday and for the last 22 days. I was fine 2 years before that, but now, we haven’t done anything new to the website or anything today, we have been taken offline.

If you have a business that uses a website DO NOT USE HOSTGATOR!!!"
"Hostgator has ripped me off on multiple occasions, ranging from not renewing my domains when they were set to auto renew, to the complete opposite, in both cases they charged me exorbitant fees to remedy the problem. In addition they have billed me for servers that I never ordered and refused to refund me the money, and never once offered to fix the problem or to pay me back for the money that they stole from me.

Stay away! There are better services out there!"
"So, I have bought a 3month package days ago thinking that I had 45 days to cancel.

I have contacted customer service and they guide me on how to get the refund (you have to cancel the whole account). They keep coming back saying that they scheduled my cancellation for July (end of my em package). They are avoiding at all costs to give me the refund and they advertise it as something they absolutely do!!!

Just don’t – really don’t use HostGator unless you have money to throw away."
"Everything started off well but things only went south from there. My website went down and they took days to respond. Then I called their customer support line, only to be told they could only help me by email. This would be just fine if they could respond to email promptly. I had to wait a week for an email reply. A week. The reply was terse and unhelpful. My problem took weeks to resolve. By then I had just had it. I asked for my money back hoping to move somewhere where “customer support” was understood to provide support for customer. A novel idea. Not here. Not at HostGator."
"First, I willingly admit I am a newbie. The jargon used in hosting/domain service is beyond me. Still, I figured I could muddle through building my own site. I already owned my domain, just needed a place to host.

I initially purchased a 3 year “hatchling” service for my very small business website. 4 pages, nothing complicated.

After 4 months, it became clear that I needed to add a blog.

In poking around the HostGator control panel, looking at plans and comparing prices, I found I had inadvertently signed up for a 3 year professional package “addon”. I called the company to request the add on be canceled, as I wasn’t yet ready to commit to an upgrade. Fine, no problem, money refunded.

Come to find out that my entire hosting package was canceled; I no longer had access to the Web Builder program. I called an spoke to a kind service rep who said that after an account is canceled there nothing that can be done. I got passed around from rep to rep, ultimately was told that canceling an “addon” is the same as canceling an entire account. I argued that calling it an “addon” implies that a basic service is maintained.

I finally got all my money refunded. I will certainly look elsewhere for hosting."
"Worst service I have ever seen from any company as a new customer. My first transition with HostGator. Simply transferring a domain name to them. Simple technical problem arose. Like Groundhog Day, I kept calling — getting the same recommended solution — following recommendation — and getting no result. I wasted many hours on the phone with these pleasant — but obviously incompetent — people. They refused, over and over again, not to put a supervisor on the line. Just terrible."
"I used HostGator when creating my first blog a year ago, and it made the process simple and fast. No problem ever with gaining access to the site, never out of service. An chat support person recently walked me through logging into the cPanel for the first time, and I love all the detailed traffic metrics it provides. Getting a freelance IT person for website help in NYC costs $50 to $175 an hour, so I really appreciated that Host Gator offered that chat support free of charge. The yearly membership fee did double once the second year began but, hey, Host Gator has to make money somehow. And to be fair to other web hosting services, I have nothing to compare HostGator with either favorably or unfavorably because it’s the only one I’ve tried."
"I have been a longtime HostGator customer, but I’m so frustrated with their customer service and increased rates, as well as the propensity to be flagged as SPAM, that I am going to switch providers. At times I’ve gotten very good customer service, but recently I have had terrible reps who do not listen and who do nothing to solve a problem. I just spent 90 minutes with a rep named Emily who was awful and falsely concluded there was no problem, so she did nothing to help resolve the matter which has been ongoing for quite some time. Wait time can be hours just connecting with a chat agent. I’ve had bad experiences with HostGator for years, and each time I’ve been convinced to upgrade my package to a more expensive one. I’ve done so with hopes the higher priced package would help the problems go away, but that has not been the case. I really despise my experience with HostGator and will be leaving as soon as possible!"
"I have hosted my client sites with Hostgator for several years and was really happy till lately.

Recently, Time-Warner began blocking emails to their customer from Hostgator IP addresses because some Hosgator customers were spamming or simply sending too many emails to TWC email customers. This means that my clients cannot use their email aliases to email any TWC customer, which has caused me no small amount of embarrassment. And my clients were sending only about two emails daily!

I have addressed the issue with Hostgator many times, and finally reached level 3 tech support. They told me that if I changed to a cloud account the issue would be corrected. I did, and it wasn’t. All they could say, then, was that there was nothing they could do. In other words, it’s my problem, even though it’s their servers that are getting blocked.

In general, Hostgator will work hard to help you resolve your Joomla issues. But if you plan to use email aliases with your site, stay away from this host. Tonight, I am moving to Siteground"
"I have a reseller account and my main account exceeded bandwidth with zero warning. Still don’t know why, because I can’t get in. There is still lots of bandwidth in the total reseller account, but because the main account is exceeded, I can’t get in to see what is going on.

The Tech was silent but I could feel the agreement when I said only terrible management would not give him to power to give 10 MB whatever of bandwidth to my main account to see what was going on, do a 5 sec adjustment to the main account to keep it open, keep our emails flowing for the biz.

Keep in mind, the reseller account as a whole still had surplus bandwidth, but because the controlling account had exceeded, with no warning, I cannot get in to fix anything. There should be an auto adjust for this.

Okay, there was a workaround, that maybe Tech should have known, so going from 3 to 7 and Tech was apologetic for time (25 mins) so I guess 8, as I am a Telus ISP Internet customer in Canada and therefore am not hard to please. Why not switch? There is an unspoken plunderocracy among the 3 big ISP players in Canada, which includes tech support that varies widely, but at the low end, which is most of the time, would fit into a Monty Python sketch.

So I didn’t get cut off, broken promises for call back or pretty well anything else, having to repeat some very basic message over and over, to the same person, like separate modem rather than traditional combo modem/router they put into houses and businesses alike; so that I can hook up a router that most businesses need with separate modem etc. etc. The parrot’s not dead, it’s pining for the fjords should be Telus’ greeting message."
"Hostgator does not offer an SSL Certificate service. If you need an SSL certificate, witch almost very one today need one because without it. Your e-mail and your website will be tags as not being secure and this will cause your e-mail to end up in a spam folder and your website will be tagged by Google or other search engines as a none secure website. You do not want any of these things to happen to you. For Hostgator to not support SSL certificate properly is very unprofessional and definitely can cause major problems for their clients. Hostgator not offering a proper SSL service is like if your bank telling you that if you don’t renew your bank pin every year and the bank will not remind you it’s your responsibility and it could take up to 1 week to set it up again. But the bank also does not tell you this information. Would you use this bank? No, you would use the bank down the street that does it all for you because you need access to your bank accounts and this is what you expect your bank will do for you. Hostgator is a hosting company this is what they are supposed to do. Do not use Hostgator if you need an SSL certificate. There are many other good companies that offer this service and will not tell you that you are in a queue and we will get to you when it is your turn."
I found Hostgator to be difficult to work with and slow. It took a full two days to get a domain name transferred and support would rather argue with me than to help. Their web site reports “error!” rather than status information and they tell me that is what they intend it to do.
"A few hours ago I signed up for the hostgator shared-business (dedicated ip plus ssl) for 3 years with 60% discount which seemed like a good deal. Previously I’d been with midphase for 3 years whose shared-business plan offered a little bit more (included a free domain) for only a little more money (extra us$20 over 3 years) and I would have stayed with midphase except the renewal was more expensive. I can’t remember who else I’d been with prior to that but over the years there have been many that I’d not use again.

I read some of the bad reviews of hostgator on this site and whilst it may be too soon to have a balanced opinion here is what I’ve found:

The initial purchase using paypal and automated site setup was fast and efficient.

They have the usual billing and cpanel arrangement that looks a little different but works the same as other hosting sites.

I didn’t have much configuring to do since I only have a few email accounts and uploaded a few folders of web content but for what I did it worked fine.

The real pain I felt about the hostgator support is that they don’t have support tickets (that I could see), they only have online chat. So far I’ve had 2 support calls (online chat) which took longer than I wanted to wait (about 15mins each) regarding SSL but both times got a resolution. Had I been able to submit a support ticket via email or online (as with midphase) then I would have been happier than sitting and waiting for the progress bar to slowly inch across the page before chatting.

Thus the lack of tickets takes a few points away from them but otherwise they seem (so far) to be doing everything right."
"I spent a little over a year with Hostgator. In that time, I started with a Hatchling plan for what was a WordPress brochure website (not a ton of traffic, so we didn’t need a lot from hosting). Our uptimes was bad. Really bad. We’d have 20-40 minute outages on a regular basis and load speeds were really slow. When I called, they told me that this was a function of the plan I was on. So I upgraded to the Business Plan. And NOTHING CHANGED. They just charged me more money for the same shitty service. So I migrated all my sites off of their servers. Now they’re trying to get me back. Good luck with that."
"I guess I’m one of the view lucky who hasn’t any complaints against HostGator.

But then again, I’m using their Cloud hosting (not the regular shared hosting).

My website is up most of the time – I assume it’s around 99.99% and the loading time is pretty fast. Especially compared with iPage which I used to use."
"I have done big mistake for going with business hosting plan with hostgator. I have paid for whole year for more than $599 USD 6 months ago, I have never seen inefficient company and such a slow server and it was better off if I donate $ 600 dollars to some charity organisation. I would not recommend any one this company. its shit company with shitty service"
"I am using Business Cloud package and in time of writing this my site is down, they messed up something about my SSL and still waiting for response. It might be that hostgator was great sometime ago. But now it is not.

Also too many restrictions in hosting account."
"No speed, no resources and the worst service I’ve ever seen. No email support, just chat and most times they don’t know how to help."
"My site was up to autorenew at $262.80, up from $50. I was no longer using the site and had almost forgotten about it. I clicked the link to cancel and my password did not work. I thought this was odd because I use a password manager (Lastpass) to hold my credentials. I tried logging on to the billing portal instead and it worked. I am currently on a 10 minute hold for live chat in hopes of cancelling."
"I set up an account, but ended up not using it, after almost a year, Hostgator told me that they were going to charge me, unless I cancelled by following a link. I followed the link, hit cancel, and thought I was done. A month later, I got notices that they were trying to process payment, but couldn’t. Knowing that I didn’t want it, I thought they would cancel. After 4 declined charges, they got my bank not only to give them all the money in my account, but actually overdraw it. It was an account that I thought was closed, but turned out it has some money, but that wasn’t enough, they wanted to take more than I had."
"Don’t waste your time calling or contacting support in any way other than their ticket system. Nobody can or will help you… The ticket system can take days to get a response, and it may not even be relevant."
"Started out loving Hostgator. They were fantastic when I was migrating our websites over from GoDaddy and our loading speeds have vastly improved. However, once we were signed up and websites were migrated, the support went downhill really fast. Not sure if they have different chat supports for prospective customers vs. current customers but I spent two hours on chat with two different agents, both of whom were unable to tell me how to access the FTP. Clearly these agents were in India, not America and helping multiple customers at the same time as they would disappear for 10-20 minutes at a time then come back and try to help me with the wrong problem. They had absolutely no clue what they were doing. On top of that, Hostgator did not migrate our entire website, they left our podcast, which is over 20GB in size. When I reopened the ticket, I called and they said it would be taken care of immediately. Fast forward a week and guess what? Nada. I feel like it’s been a bait and switch with the tech support. My advice – always call, don’t do chat support because you’re being sent off to Bangalore. If you are highly technical and can handle your websites yourself, that’s great, but for people like myself who need help occasionally, it’s disappointing."
"I have a reseller account at Hostgator. I am using a very long and auto generated password to access my reseller account (WHM).

In the last few months the reseller account has been hacked and hackers have deleted all my sites. What is important to note about a reseller account (WHM) is that it is just a web interface hosted and managed by Hostgator which allows you to configure different things, such as setting up new sites and DNS. The WHM is not a site in itself and I have no freedom to configure WHM itself.

Even so, I received the same response from their customer support for about 20 times, that they will take no responsibility for security problems in my account because I might have compromised security by putting malware or scripts on the accounts. Every time they ignore the fact that none of my sites were hacked, only their own WHM platform, managed by them.<

Finally, today, after 3 months, someone actually read what I wrote. He said that they couldn’t know for sure whether I have a keylogger installed on my laptop, so that might be how it was hacked. The key here is they won’t investigate it at all, because who knows, it could possibly be a keylogger on my laptop that showed the password to a hacker.

They don’t seem to mind spending hours after hours sending me bullshit answers in the support, but spending any time at all to actually look into their own security problems is not interesting. Why do they spend so much energy NOT solving any problems? Who does it benefit. Certainly not me. Certainly not themselves, because they just manage to piss off a large customer.

They want me to pay them to look into their own security problems. No thanks.

Additionally, at the first hack I discovered the issue before they managed to make any damage to my account. However, they acknowledged receiving my message, but explicitly refused to do anything to prevent the hacker from causing harm to my account. Again, even if they are just following processes, what kind of process is this? Who came up with these rules that the support team is apparently following.

However, I would like to acknoledge that they at least have been responding to my messages regularly. That’s why they get a rating of 2 instead 1."
"Recently I migrated my blog from my local hosting to HostGator and found the service much appreciated.

It took me just a few hours my entire blog along with all the data, plugins, themes, posts and CPANEL to be migrated to HostGator’s fast Turbo servers.

Feel much better with their Service.<"
"I spent over 10 years with HostGator. For the first 7 or so, things were great. But around 2015, their performance began to slip. By 2016, they left me no choice (as my sites were down for over a week and no responses from support) but to move my host.

Thus, I don’t recommend their hosting. I also had a domain that was registered with them that I forgot was there (long term commitment). Now, I’ve been trying to transfer that domain and it’s been 9 days and they still haven’t released the domain registry to the new domain registry company.

So, in short – STAY AWAY!!"
"I work full time, and act as the web guru for a business my sister and I own. I don’t have time for complications–when I purchased a WordPress hosting package from HostGator I expected them to walk me through what needed to be done. For some odd reason I have one login my “customer account” and one for my “control panel” perhaps so these can be given to different people? No idea why. I went with HostGator because I was able to use WordPress’ free period to get my website up and looking the way I wanted, before I paid for it–since I work full time all this had to be done when I had spare time. I paid for my package and suddenly my website was down. I called, and tech support was nice and seemed very helpful, and my website was up again. This happened over and over, NOT ONCE, until long after my “free transfer” had expired, did ANYONE ask me if I had requested a migration. WTF? I feel like everything I want to do is more complicated than it needs to be–so they can get to pay for someone else to do it. My full time job is software support, I get paid to figure this stuff out–and I have a hard time figuring out HostGator! My sister and I just decided that it was a lesson learned and money down the tube. We’ve given up and we’re going with a different service."
"Very bad customer support. They made it very complicated to access my account but gladly and very easily accepted my 300 dollars for 3 years.

as of now, I stopped using it but got no refund.

Stay away from them at all cost."
"Our company has rented a dedicated server from HostGator for a couple of years, as well as using them as a registrar. The uptime and performance of the server have been as you’d expect. Mostly no issues. However, their customer service is basically non-existent. Their live chat operators basically don’t understand anything about the products they are working with, and will often disappear for 10 minutes at a time without saying anything, and then come back with an answer to a question I didn’t even ask

You might think that this isn’t much of an issue since you might not need support that much, but when you do need it, it’s usually when something has gone wrong. If your website has gone down, or your server is not responding, and you need qualified help with that issue, that’s when you’ll be in for a big problem. Your agent will not know anything, and all they will be able to do is make a ticket after making you wait for an hour or more. That ticket may be answered quickly, but more often it will be simply closed without comment, or closed as ‘Resolved’ when the problem still exists, or just ignored for days, and perhaps even weeks.

Currently, we have a ticket that’s been on hold for over a week now, because we transferred a domain into HostGator and it hasn’t shown up in our control panel. That ticket has been closed twice over a two week period with no explanation, and any actual responses have basically said that they don’t know what the issue is, and they’ll be back in touch when they do.

A few days ago they charged us $4000 on one of our credit cards for no reason that we can discern, relating to an invoice that is not due for quite a while. When we contacted them they, of course, had no explanation, and couldn’t figure out why it was charged. They couldn’t refund it though. They have to, you guessed it, open a ticket."
"I reactivated an account that someone tried to access in 2008. Not even the name on the account but yesterday I signed on to a new account and they apparently already had me in the system. I said great, but come to find out it was frozen based on their Fraud department wanting me to submit all this info to verify the transaction. Great business practices. Instead of saying ok it is active but if you dont verify in X days we will deactivate my account. The rep said nothing about this issue or else I would have made a new account and avoided the hoolie. Regardless now I am waiting to the fraud idiots to review my email and activate my account. Meanwhile I am loosing $1000’s every minute that server isn’t provisioned. Thanks Hostgator. Oh yea the best part is these a holes dont have direct contact numbers. LOL what a joke."
"Very disappointed, they just charged me 150$ for their service, After 10 days hard to get response, I almost became rude to get respond from them, they promised me to give me good discount on this year, i had a open ticket for that but they did not give me any discount.

I was with this company for 5 years and this company started really good but they are not good now , They know how to charge people’s credit card, you realize they charged you for un-necessary services which you never know about these services and if you have free time you have to fight with them to return that money to your account, poor customer service. If you value your time, DON’T GO WITH HOSTGATOR"
"This is my first experience with HostGator, while some have had a great experience this has not been the case for me. None of the techs have ever been able to explain why I will always have “builder” in front of my domain name despite the migration having been completed now for over two weeks. How dumb will that look on a business card? I am well within my 45 day money back guarantee window and when I ask for this using online chat its crickets.

Overall a very sad organization but that is what happens when you are bought by a larger organization which also owns several other hosting companies such as sitey, bluehost and ipage I believe.

Anyway I will likely stick with my FB page or go with wix, they seem to be more no non-sense. Bottom line buyer beware the online tech support is not hit or miss."
"My client’s usage exceeded the hostgator limit according them, even though it is unlimited shared hosting. They blocked and suspended the account, and client could not use POP/IMAP to retrieve emails as requested by Hostgator to free up space. We requested for 48horus to allow the client to retrieve all emails via outlook, but no one has ever bothered to respond to the tickets. Support tickets have gone answered for 12days now. I have engaged live chat support several times and they all claim to forward my requests to senior admins, who alone have the right to unlock the account for backup of emails. After 10 days of no response, we had to get a new hosting for the client, so they can use their emails. It is a shame how they claim to care about customers, but take it from me, it is a lie."
"Hostgator tries to double or triple charge me early for the ssl certificate and other charges. Maybe there is problem with the billing department set up or something, but since I brought it up to them year after year I suspect that they are actually trying to bank this way. It is extremely anying having to solve the same overcharge issues early, especially after my website’s certificate expires and I mis business. All in all, they really suck!"
"Hostgator used to be OK 5-10 years ago but in 2017 they are well behind. Woeful support, slow servers and Hostgator policies if anything goes wrong are woeful. Once they issue an invoice, they call it your balance even if it is wrong or not what you want.

Save yourself the heartache. Don’t sign up to Hostgator."
"I was perfectly satisfied with Dreamhost except for one thing: the very low quality of email services. Hostgator has been fine and especially email — fast and dependable. The most frustrating aspects of Hostgator are (1) the technical shallowness of their Tech Support, (2) therefore, the defensiveness of their Tech Staff … to the point where they cannot cooperate in problem-solving, and (3) the undependability of their support tools. On Dreamhost I saw maybe 2,000 visitors each week. When I migrated to Hostgator, the hit rate reduced to nearly nil. Huh?! Just not plausible! So, I asked a dozen friend to visit my site simultaneously while I did an “Update Now” on their stats-reporting software. It registered *no one*. I then looked at their raw data and saw 100 records piling up. I alerted the Hostgator tech that they had a bug. Her response: “We can’t help it if your site is unpopular(!)” So buried in defensivness that can’t be bothered with a solid bug report. TIme to move on. But to which host service?"
"Same ticket: 10 hours for a response, then 8 hours till the next one. 2 hours after that (total of 20 hours in to the issue) I called and spoke to a live person. After an hour and a half on the phone with them, I was told sorry, but there’s nothing they can do about it.

What is ‘it’? The type of ssl that I purchased requires both an organization, and an organizational unit. Thier csr generating form has a field for the unit, but it doesn’t incorporate it in the csr generated. But they’ll be more than happy to sell me their overpriced ssl, which would work."
"I have been a customer at HostGator for 3 years, both in domain and hosting. I had a .com domain for 2 years, and it expired/lost it, and made a .net domain (with HostGator, again) and transferred my site to that. Within a week of transferring files e.t.c. the site was up and running smoothly. I run my site passively as it doesn’t require maintenance and I am busy in school to keep it updated, but it serves as a platform for prospect graduate students to enhance their standardized test taking abilities. After 6 months I check up on my website, only to be greeted with a big fat red “This domain is suspended” and a paragraph under it about failure to verify the email address. For 6 months, I was paying hosting and domain for NOTHING, for HostGator to publish that page as if I violated a terms and conditions or the law. I had never received an email from HostGator. I spent an hour with online support as they tried to figure out the email situation and finally I received an actual email. The resolution was that, finally receiving an email and being told to wait another 2 days for the site to go back live. I paid for an annual hosting and domain, only to utilize half of it while HostGator shut down my site because I did not verify my email. The same email I had used prior with my .com domain and hosting for 2 years. As soon as my plan ends, I will be migrating to a hosting company that are not thieves, regardless if the price is extra. Avoid this company."
I used their live chat twice to resolve an issue. Both times the customer service reps took a while to respond when I asked questions and left me waiting. The first rep could not even type a proper English sentence. It was full of run on sentences and misspelled words. Hostgator needs to check on who they are hiring and insure that they have the basic communication skills.
"I hosted with hostgator. Now I regret my decision 100%. SQL server been having issues in the past 2 days. Now, the ftp server is down too. How are they 99.9% up time? That is simply a LIE! Their customer support is also THE WORST I have ever experienced. I contact them via live chat. I was told there was no error, I told the support member to check the error log, and he literally just refused. Just refused… I don’t even know where to begin… Hostgator will be gone, it won’t be long!"
"Hostgator are the worst hosting company you could ever imagine. no response from customer service and i was advised to send an email feedback@hostgaor.com but there is no response from anyone either. This is week number 4 and my services are still down, my whole company business depends on the hosting plan. They have canceled my purchase due to account verification and refunded my payment, then i went to hell an back trying to reconnect it. Got charged gain on the 27th Dec 2017 and was promised 24h to 48h for reconnection but nothing happened until this minute. Customer service says they have no idea why my dedicated server package has not been active until now! (Who is supposed to know?) My paid domains have been deleted and I have no control over them, some got released back to the public! Useless service and if I get to rate them I will give them zero stars. Wonder what the reply on my comment will be other than “We are sorry for your bad experience, please send an email to feedback and we will look into this issue”. Well, I have done that 4 times already! I made an international call and I was kept on hold for 53 minutes and then the guy answered and told me it is out of his control, he has no explanation why this is happening and tht he can cancel my account for me if I wanted! . No responsibility, not professionalism and they had a huge negative impact on my company. Stay away from this Hostgator."
"I have had HostGator as host for my company website and other websites for years. Mostly it has been a positive experience.

However, I just looked at my billing for December and found HostGator charged me for Domain Privacy. They don’t tell me for which of my 4 domains in the bill, and NONE of my domains has Domain Privacy enabled. It’s only a $12.95 error, but I chatted them up to clear up the problem.

I gave the person the invoice number. From that should should be able to see everything…

The support person asked me several, “Which domain has Domain Privacy enabled?”

I kept saying NONE. I DO NOT HAVE DOMAIN PRIVACY. WHY AM I CHARGED?

They kept saying they were looking into it…

I had to explain the issue 3 times.

I asked them which domain does that invoice ## pertain to?

After nearly an hour in the support chat window, the support person had to write up a ticket to get billing people to look into it. Why didn’t they do that to start with?!?

So, HostGator wasted my time and probably more than $12.95 for 1 hour of that support person plus more money for the next person that looks at the ticket… DUMB DUMB DUMB

When I have time, I’ll look into other hosting options."
I have had Hostgator for several years. I am currently on hold for over SEVENTEEN MINUTES at 9pm. That is typical; every time I call I know I will face a loooooong wait time. I wait so long it makes me wonder if there’s even anyone there. I recently opened an account with another hosting company and they also have 24/7 support and answer the phone as it rings without any hold time. I hate calling Hostgator.
"The customer service guys are not knowledgeable and I used to contact them 5-6 times to get a reasonable customer support guy to fix an issue. I am running a web company and during the renewals I am moving the hosting to new providers. They were good few years back and now awful. Customer support people raising my BP, especially while talking to ladies."
"My first site in 2013 was on the babyplan by hostgator. My dad recommended them as he had been with them for years before that. I loved their customer service and platform. So when my mom wanted me to build her a website I used hostgator in 2015. It was wonderful and customer service was great. Then in January 2018 I built by boyfriend's website and we had some real problems that still haven't been worked out. It started with being double billed for multiple accounts when there was only one. That was worked out and I tried to contact them about site speeds but they couldn't help, it was like they weren't even listening. The final straw was when I wanted to add an additional site to my mom's account and the website place holder was this weird search site and even when I redirected and downloaded Word Press it was still there. I called them about it and they didn't know what I was talking about and wouldn't help me. So I went to SiteGround and the experience has been wonderful. My site isn't up yet but the place holder is really cute...it says that a really great website is about to be born. I really love siteground so far and I am so sorry that Hostgator has become such a bad hosting site."
Signed up with these in July 2017 and it has been a nightmare. We use it to host test websites for clients in development and the 502 - Bad Gateway error is now almost a permenant thing. I gave up about 10 days ago and asked support to close my account but support is so bad they have not even responded yet. I have no idea where the 99% uptime stats are coming from as we have had less than 50%.
"my old hosting was about to be up for renewal, so I thought I would shop around. I could get 3 years at hostgator for the price of 1 year at my old host. so I made the switch. its been two weeks since starting the process and I currently do not have my website. when I originally contacted them to ask questions, I told them I am very unknowledgeable on how all this hosting and transferring works and repeatedly asked if I switch to them if my website will be fully switched and transferred so I wouldnt have to redo the whole thing. yes was the answer multiple times. now its...well theres waiting for this and waiting for that... and fill out this form and do this blah blah blah. so my ""website"" finally came up today (only on my phone, not on my desktop) but it wasn't all of my information and hard work. it was basically a blank page. so after 20 minutes of waiting for a chat person they tell me to fill out a form. I don't know ""the answers"" I am supposed to put in the form spaces and apparently neither do they. total waste of time. not to mention, you ask them a question and it takes 5-7 minutes to reply each time. I eventually ended the chat because it.. once again... got me nowhere!! I'm not sure whoever they have for their chat support really know what they are doing. so here I am...no website STILL. saving the amount of $$ is not worth all this hassle."
"I have had multiple hostgator accounts over the years and now I have finally reached the last attempt in dealing with this company. The constant sign-ups for unsolicited items is too much.

They have a horrible support system, they have actually removed support tickets from their site, making you sit on chat for support to only be passed off to the next possibly less informed agent.

DO NOT BUY HOSTGATOR - GO TO A BIG COMPANY like AWS if you want real quality."
"Required to verify myself to reset my access so I could cancel my hosting as the domain was de-registered in December 2017. Got no response from support via email so I had to go online to chat and make it clear that I need to reset my credentials to get access to cancel hosting before next yearly charge was taken from my credit card. Finally got the procedure and sent the required info to them. I then sent them multiple request for updates for the cancellation of hosting, but still no response from support. It seems they wanted to drag out the time so they could bill me for another year of hosting a non-existent domain. Finally I get a response from them with new login credentials and guess what? They don't work, so once again they are not working with me to try and cancel the hosting, they just don't care. Responded back to tell them the credentials don't work, and once again they just ignore the response to the ticket. Checked my credit card statement and gee guess what, they billed my card before sending me the wrong login details. How convenient that they do not want to respond when someone want to cancel their service before billing happens. It works well in their favor, and the longer the muck the customer around the more they can take from their credit card.

I have kept all correspondence and it shows that I made it clear I wanted to cancel before next billing, and have even advised them that they are not to take another payment as I am trying to cancel the hosting, but they still took it. So I have now made a formal complaint to my bank requesting a refund of the charges as they are clearly defrauding customers to try and get as much money as they can be acting ignorant and ignoring requests. How stupid are these people when you tell them you want to cancel and you want to do it before next billing, and then magically they seem to become unresponsive, send incorrect information, drag it out as long as possible, all in an effort to charge me another year of hosting for a domain that no longer exists.

Be warned, they are very dishonest given their actions, and they do not respond to support issues for weeks/months which is totally unacceptable and doesn't make sense as to why they would do this unless they want to rip people off.

It's rather sad as I have given them nothing but top scores and high praise for their hosting over the past few years, but get ripped off in the end for all my efforts.

My opinion is to find another hosting company that has good reviews when it comes to how they treat customers."
"Hostgator initially promises unmetered disk space (1 TB) on all their cloud hosting packages and once you start using it for your email and you reach around 75 GB, you will receive an email saying that you have exceeded our usage policy and unmetered disk space is used for website files only and you will be forced to remove your emails from their server.

Never trust these guys on their fake promises.

Hostgator - very bad hosting.

There are other who are out there who offer real value for money."
"I'm a reseller & took advantage of free migration. One site I manage, a salon, was LOST in the migration. The site went down over the Christmas season so they took a big hit which meant a big hit for me. I only accidentally found the cpanel they mistakingly set up outside of my package (linked from an email confirmation). Tech couldn't find it, then couldn't figure out how it happened nor fix. Now issues with super slow page loads and tech only points me to tutorials for speeding up sites. I've done everything I can do at my end. I don't mind doing the work, it's my job to look after clients but it seems HG turns that job into a headache. I dread contacting support because the calls often end with links to ""how to figure it out yourself"" and they also want to up sell. I'm shopping around now for faster server, better support, affordable (gotta make a living)"
"Like in the article, it renewed, price jumped from $140 to $250. As I wasn't online during this time (sailing long term) I was hit at the bank account. So I cancelled when I got back to the land of the internet. They placed the cancellation date three years from date of cancellation. Basically the refused to refund as per their policy of cancellation. Its entirely their discretion. So my domain name email comes in for renewal. It says I will be billed in late April. Its early April and I tried to cancel it. Their policy is to charge 30 days before the due date. That's not written on the email however. The have a cancellation page that forces you to go via a support person. For your protection. Funny, I can sign up for anything without a support person, they won't refund money if I do, and this is all after signing onto their site. No verification to sign up, they require verification and a live chat to support to cancel. They are protecting their wallets by shady practices. Do not recommend at all."
"Hostgator has zero customer service. You call in via voice or text and are given a different story as to why your website is down. Each time they say the previous person didn't know what they were talking about. We had a VPS and they took it down during the busy Christmas holidays. 1st call they said they took it down during middle of the workday for maintenance. Called back again got a different story. Finally hours later learned one site had been hacked so they took the entire server down and never notified us. This cost us a great deal of business. If they would have been upfront as to the issue we could have gotten back online much sooner.

This is just one example of how they deal with issues. Their servers are slow. They don't respond to support tickets. Hostgator takes your money but doesn't deliver."
This has been the worst experience ever. We have been waiting TWO WEEKS for migration. Not one person can tell us what is going on. They just say that they are backed up. They have no way besides email to contact migration and no one ever responds. Don't use this company unless you want no site and no answers!!!
"Lost hours of my time contacting support due to constant downtime issues. They always refused having any downtime and instead reworded it each time we have a scheduled maintenance. Maintenances no customers were ever aware of. Lost $100's of dollars in sales. Their technical support lacks knowledge and experience. I have 20+ years in customer support and tech support so I know what I am talking about. Stay away from them.

I now changed to SiteGround."
"There is no option in the UK to contact them for support except the terrible chat system which you will wait up to an hour to connect with a person who has less technical knowledge than my cat. They will reply very slowly and use annoying phrases like asking how you are instead of getting on with the job - which they can't do in the end. In the end you get through to the ticket system, but after they replied incorrectly to my issue (not solving it) they closed the ticket and I had to go back to the stupid chat system. As a business owner, this is not an acceptable service for resellers. Disappointing would be an understatement. I will be moving as soon as possible."
"1. They sold out to a company in November 2018 and since then you will have to wait indefinitely to be connected to live chat support. Their chat room doesn't notify you with a sound when receiving new messages. So be prepared to be on that very page (waiting for several minutes) because if you go to a new tab and they keep writing you, they will quit the chat and leave. (yes, you are welcome), happened to me!

2. Many unqualified agents in chat rooms: they have no idea what you clearly ask for. They will give you totally different answers or shamefully create a ticket so that a higher admin will attend to you via email --you gonna have to waaaaaiit for that. I have over 20 domains with them and I won't recommend them. Try bluehost."
I purchased domain and website builder through them so I could have a small web presence but was also promised 1 free email which is really what I wanted it for so I could have an email linkedin to my site. Got my site live today and told now they charge for email. Asked for a full refund because the email is what I wanted it linked to my site. Promised one thing then try to charge me more when they backed out of original offer
I've been with hostgator for over 2 years now and I found their support not helpful at all. I got malware and they provide no solution except redirecting me to another company to pay them more. They advertise a very very cheap plan but after being with them for 2 years and having so many downtimes they charging me over $500 to renew my hosting. I'm not happy with this host at all and I don't recommend it to anyone.
So we have been hosting our website with them for over a year and everything was ok. A few downtime issues but not major. Then they disabled our website with very little information. After hours of trying to contact them we gleaned we had been hacked via a plugin and told us to update it. At this stage we can't access the site to change anything. After 24 hours of our website being offline they admit we weren't hacked and that our backup service was loading the CPU too much. The same backup service we had been using for the whole time we had been with Hostgator. We ended up migrating to another host and had it up and running before Hostgator got around to responding in any serious manor. Don't use them if your website is important!
"Last night they took my site down because it supposedly had too much CPU usage, I had 31 visits, 124MB of bandwidth used. It's been 24 hours and they still haven't gotten my site restored, they haven't even whitelisted my IP addresses so I can do anything about it.

Not only this, their hosting is incredibly slow, average page load times around 5-8 seconds PER PAGE.

So here I am, I bought new hosting, luckily I had a backup from a few days ago I could restore, I'll be taking everything off of Hostgator and will never return."
"I am investigating domain hosts in order to transfer my site. I was very unimpressed with HG's chat. They outsource it to the same service that A Small Orange uses, and the reps don't speak great English. It took forever for the rep to answer each question, and I kept begging him to look at the top of the chat to see what my question was, so I wouldn't need to rewrite it. Unless I made a mistake, you also can't get a copy of the chat, so if you don't write down everything that was said (or do a screenshot), you will not have a record of the info."
"HostGator has been nothing but great. I have a dedicated Windows server and I write my own pages. Everything has worked great from day one. When I've needed help, tech support is local (USA), knowledgeable and professional. Any issues I've had, which mostly stem from SSL expirations, have been solved within hours. They've also been helpful managing my server as I am not confident in my skills when it comes to that. I don't know what all these negative reviews entail but they need to be balanced with a report of a good experience. This is one. If you take responsibility for your own work, HostGator is the place to be."
"Often slow but working most of the time. We mainly use the site for back office jobs. Since the visible part is an entry for other websites, and a blog more set for google than for our customers, we don't complain as long as the databases work."
"I've been with Hostgator for about 2 1/2 years, I think. I'm surprised to see the many critical reviews, but perhaps my use of web space doesn't get me into issues with providers. I transferred several domains and their files to Hostgator and was running with no particular trouble that I remember. This included a Wordpress site, which made the transfer and was running right away. I'm not aware of any significant downtime over the last couple of years, but my sites are very low on access. Mainly, as I'm retired, I do several sites as a public service, a few for family needs, and some for myself. None would produce any heat on a server. I don't recall any issues over the past few years, so I have had almost no contact with Hostgator support. I load the files, configure the domains, and away we go. Nothing is too sophisticated or complicated. Since I can't recall any particular problem or issue, I can't do anything except give them 5 stars. I'm probably up for renewal in the new year, and I hope for no issues there."
I have been using HostGator since 2011. I haven't had any problems with my website. To my knowledge (I've had someone overseeing it for me) my site has only gone down one time in 8 years. I'd say that's pretty good. I've used their customer service and have been satisfied. Overall I have been very happy with HostGator
"Much, much better since changing from our old hosting partner. Only one mysterious issue of loading problems, eventually went away. Support team is very friendly and helpful."
"The hostingfacts review talks about Industry-Standard Pricing ‘Tricks’ but I was so annoyed with their renewal tactics that I will look for another hosting service before my next renewal.

Six weeks before my renewal date, they emailed that they would automatically renew for a year. Twenty-four days before that renewal date, they emailed that invoices are generated 6 days prior to renewal date. Two weeks before my renewal date, they charged my credit card. When I called immediately to tell them I wanted to make a change and also stop the renewal of an addon, they told me it was too late even though it was still at least a week before my renewal date.

Otherwise, the service seems reliable enough. Early on, there was a period of difficulty with emails bouncing which resolved after a few weeks without any indication of the reason."
"Overall an average experience. Hostgator pushed WordPress for a while but I hated it, too complicated for website use. For cost, do not get enough pages. As fees go up, need to look for another host. Other than that, website works although website maintenance too seems clunky. Tech Support usually good but takes a while to reach someone after 5 PM and on weekends."
"I've been with HostGator for a couple years now for hosting my website. The service has been consistent and even when I needed Tech Support, they were efficient, fast and courteous. That gets five stars. The one star is for the over promise under deliver pitch for SEO and web design services, lack of candor and forthrightness in explaining process, giving evidence that work being charged for is actually being done, total unresponsiveness of supervisors to contact me ""at all"" to discuss questions and issues. The biggest of which is embedding their proprietary SEO technology on my website without telling me what those were upfront, and that at the end of six month agreement, all the SEO technology would require a monthly fee to sustain or all technology would be removed and all SEO benefits removed. This also was not explained or even touched upon up front. The whole affair is now three months in and I have not heard from the project coordinator in weeks. Caveat Emptor Folks. Don't be taken by this unprofessional department at HostGator."
"Never had a problem until this year. I pay for services and renewals and they never get done. I have to contact support and they apologize and assure me that everything would be taken care of. It takes an average of 3 support chats to finally get the issue fixed. For my domain renewal I even contacted support early to make sure it would renew so my site wouldn't go down. I was assured I was fine and not to worry. My domain expired and my site went down. Currently I am going through this same scenario with my SSL certificate. I have begged the Chat Support Tech to give me a phone number to call the main office to review my account. Unfortunately, he just forwarded my case to billing/admin support. This will be the second time being referred to them due to the ""seriousness"" of the issue."
"One of my friends was a customer of Hostgator in the past, had many issues with them and told me to stay away from them. I decided to give them a try, and purchase their best reseller hosting account. Only two days, I have had to call them about 20 times about issues that can only be fixed by contacting Hostgator support. The support reps, hardly know what their doing, I kept getting passed around from one rep to another.

The WHMCS license they provided had issues, giving me a invalid license key error TWICE!

The second time the web advisor had to contact WHMCS that would take a day, and they put in a request for someone else’s domain, which I had no idea who’s it was when on the phone it was confirmed several times that it was for my domain.

I now went to Inmotion Hosting, and their customer service is great, cpanel works much smoother, and it’s much easier to use the Softaculous installer then Hostgator’s own QuickInstall."
"Whenever you see the top ten Website Host's, be advised at least eight of them are always owned by the same company. Including Hostgator. This means you will always run into the same issues where it concerns billing. I have used two of those companies. Most recently Hostgator. Neither would stop billing. After Live Chat plus calling and speaking to a live person on numerous occasions and having guarantees they would stop Billing, including with Emails showing the date and conversation transcripts, a year after shutting one of my websites down Hostgator continued Billing, forcing me to block them off my Credit Card permanently and filing a claim to get my money back through my Credit Card company. So keep in mind once they get your Credit Card info, you are going to have a heck of a time getting them to stop Billing you if you decide to close down your website.

Their lower tier Tech Support is completely incompetent. They know nothing at all about the product and escalating to higher tier seemed to take days and the problems were never corrected. Constant database problems made it not worth the time or money.

Shared hosting, their lower tier, is useless unless you use outdated software versions. For example VB5 uses an SQL version higher than what is available on Hostgator shared Hosting tier, almost every company not affiliated with Hostgators parent company already offers the updated SQL Version on their lowest tier, not this company, this company requires you buy into higher tiers. So if you want to run a basic Forum, you will have to use outdated software full of security holes unless you agree to upgrade to a higher, more expensive tier. If you don't want to, and decide to switch Host's, then you are stuck in the Billing they refuse to stop. They also lie about their upgrades claiming its coming. I heard the lies from Tech Support for close to two years.

* Nonstop Billing even after numerous requests to stop Billing
* Weekly Downtime often exceeds Uptime.
* Incompetent Tech Support.
* Outdated SQL.
* Extremely slow.
* Upload and download capped more significantly than other non related Host's.
* Migration might as well be nonexistent its so slow.
* Failure to have updated SQL requires software use with security holes because some of the lower software Vers are no longer supported after the company moves on.

The extremely low priced shared tier serves one purpose, to sucker customers in and force you to buy into a higher tier. That is their solution for everything. And when you say no and change service, they won't stop charging you no matter how many times you tell them to stop, and this wasn't just Hostgator, it included one of Hostgator's sister companies (Host's).

This also adds up to a poor user experience for the end user of your website or forum. Loss of funds when you decide to change Host's and Includes making the end user vulnerable through outdated software.

My recommendation is to avoid this company and any of the sister companies under their parent company. The low cost shared tier is a complete sham."
"Don't know much about hosting services... Hostgator is the 2nd one I've used. For more than a year I've been having issues with auto-reply emails from my site going into customers spam folders. I have lost hundreds of hours chatting with support trying to solve the problem. Not only they have never been able to solve the problem, but they make it worse frequently as when they try to solve that I end up not being able to receive emails on my Gsuite/Gmail account. I'm trying to search for a different server, but I'm afraid it may give the same problems? Thanks,"
"refuse to refund my money after purchasing a VPS account for around $1100 dollars. Only offers partial refunds and adds in fake charges without a clear indication why.

Don't use hostgator they have condescending live chat who always tells the customer is wrong when all I requested was a full refund. Live chat who refuse to do due diligence and check for accounting errors but refuse to even bother. Just horrendous customer service.

Their servers are slow meaning they still use HDD instead of SSD like other web hosting providers. Their servers are slow and it results in slow loading websites (even with websites that have no content) and it's a way to upsell you to buy expensive packages. Too many tricks and lying destroyed the customer relationship trust. Go with a different hosting provider anything is better than hostgator."
"Couldn't point my Host Gator domain to my website to save my life. cpanel is completely nonexistent on my account. Thought it was a good service after seeing recommendations so went with the 3-year hosting plan. BIG MISTAKE. After realizing how un-user friendly HostGator is, tried to cancel, but because I chose a plan over a year, they ""offered"" (i.e. automatically signed me up) the ""free"" domain registration, which then becomes a non-refundable $17.99 fee if you cancel in less than a year (they hide this detail when you sign up). If I had gone with one of the shorter monthly plans, this apparently wouldn't have happened. But, when you sign up for a 1+ year plan, they don't give you the option to opt-out of the ""free"" domain registration. Also, paid $24 for WHOIS privacy protection, but if you want it refunded you have to request a new refund transaction to have this done. Found another domain host that offers this protection for free, but can't transfer to this service until the 60 day ICANN grace period, but would have to request a refund within Hostgator 45-day money back ""guarantee"". So, my email, etc. linked to my domain would be spam fodder for 15 days if I want a privacy protection refund within their time limit. Customer service could only politely tell me how much I got tricked into paying for their nonrefundable services. Their online chat is a slow nightmare. It takes at least several minutes to get a response to each of your replies, where you can easily waste upwards of 2 hours waiting.
Don't be fooled by their low prices. You'll pay for it in the end. Run far, far away."
"I am surprised, even to the point of shock to read these bad reviews on Hostgator. I used to with a Nigerian hosting company and the issue was its frequent downturns. My friend strongly recommended that I move to Hostgator as HG has been serving him well for a couple of years now. I migrated. First, I was impressed that they helped me migrate for free and I was more than impressed by their 45-day money back guarantee. In the early days, I contacted their support nearly everyday and I found them courteous, patient, and helpful. I once contacted them just to retrieve my login details. But reading this set of reviews made me wonder. Perhaps I am only seeing the good side of them. Perhaps I run a small outfit and am bound to run into trouble when I escalate my portfolio. I earnestly hope not, but that doubt is there; like a small foreboding attached to my growth. No organization is perfect and I hope this is just the 3% dissatisfied group that is writing this. My rating is actually 4.5 but since there are no half stars here, the full thing. And it is based on my individual experience alone. Would change when they change. I hope not."
"As per the article, its very very true that they are very slow (like a speed of a tortoise). Instead I would say they have the slowest servers. Not only this, there servers are not even capable of taking any of the load. For instance, if you have just 4 products, and you try to edit them at one time.. 3 of them will be presented with a so call beautiful logo of hostgator saying sorry we can't take this shit load. And only 1 product will be updated successfully after 5 minutes of loading (as I mentioned, pathetic server speed). See attached screenshot. I have wasted all the money as they now say we cant refund you because I have just crossed 40 days time as I was just busy in development of the website. Very smart strategy of looting people. I am now hosted with another hosting provider who are providing far better speed then this shit!

"I have been with the hostgator for many years and although their customer service is good my dedicated server goes down at least once or twice a month. I have about 40 wordpress sites on the server and a lot of unhappy clients. They always give me the same excuse that is was caused by an attack on the server from an unknown IP address. I don't believe this is the cause.

"I host several sites for different kind of sites and customers, tried many hosting suppliers big and small and Hostgator still reliable, good support, good rates and good performance, I have been using them for more than 8 Years"
"I paid for their extra SEO plan which consistently crashed every time I tried to open it or the basic SEO plan. Service tickets were open for 2 months while they kept sending messages that they were working on it. After 2 months I gave up and changed companies. All you are paying for with this company is canned apology remarks about why they can't make their own products work.

BTW, they refused to refund any amount for the website for their expensive premium SEO that never worked for a single minute.

"I have had, over time, anything up to 20-30 websites with Hostgator shared. At the moment it is down to about 6. Speed is their biggest problem overall. The load times can be atrocious. But my biggest issue lately / right now is that all my sites, email accounts and cpanel have gone down for 15-20 mins, then suddenly come back online. I have had their tech support look at this but they can never find out what the problem was. They always suggest to call when the problem is happening but by the time they answer the chat the sites are all backed up and everything is working

I'm looking at moving to another host and probably going with VPS.

"I use the server to host my clients. It makes life easy, gives me access to tech support when clients try to do something on their own and break it all, and has been a pleasant experience. This is the third server package I have purchased since 2005. I keep coming back and they keep letting me. It works."
"In an age where ""hosting-is-hosting"" and it's ""good"" everywhere you go, hosting companies are 'getting ahead' of the competition on price and customer support and Hostgator toes the line. They make GoDaddy look like amateurs. And Hostgator is CONSIDERABLY less expensive. Hostgator is the best hosting value available at this writing. And that comes from a power user with 12 hosting accounts spread out over 5 different companies. (It's better for SEO to have your domains on different servers and IP's)

They're generous with their iNodes, and the space. They have nimble servers. When they tell you that they can give you a product or service, for example, Widget ""A"" there are no apologies later when they can't.

I get that at a lot of hosts. Sales overpromising. Not at Hostgator. Their customer support has let me down ONCE in 3 years. Brian Christian. I was thinking ""wtf?"" is he NEW? Never found out. Besides that one time, I've had everything fixed in one try and I'm not talking about restarting the server or troubleshooting Wordpress. I'm talking about doping out .htaccess rewrites and handling CSR SSL installations, proper glue on a private nameserver and deactivation of WP Plugins even through a catastrophic failure and 500 Internal Server Error that prevents any client-side fix. These guys are GREAT. So there you have it. You can find cheaper. But you better know what you're doing and be practically self-service, because you're not getting any backup when you try to bootstrap your .wordpress backup restore via FTP or figure out where your excess iNodes are hiding. Hostgator's got your back.

"Working on my first website, really pleased with Hostgator thus far. I've used their support which was perfect! i'm seeing evidence they've got the bases covered and have all the features i'll ever need, easy to access. Yea, yea the price doubles after the initial period or whatever.. don't think i'll hold it against them.. it's not like my website will have many other outgoings to cover."
The server and support service so far satisfactory. I am able to contact the support desk at a reasonable time and have provided very good support.
"Been on a shared server since September 2019, due to testing encountered an over-usage CPU problem and had a site blocked. Attempting to have it back live without success for one week. Customer service keeps promising and promising but never delivers. Ended up changing hosting providers since we were losing business day after day.... Never again !!"
"I hate leaving bad reviews, but this is too important not to share. We are a small company and we don't do any marketing email, only billing and answering questions for customers. Our emails on Hostgator constantly get flagged as unwanted spam, phishing, etc. They say we have to upgrade to get on a ""clean"" server, which seems wrong.

Since this was the 5th time calling about the emails getting flagged as spam or phishing, I was ready to do that, but customer service dropped the call (not us, it went to the survey- so it was her hanging up) So, I called right back and after sitting on hold for 20 minutes, no one picked up, then in the chat help, it said 15 minutes for help and it was over an hour. By the time someone answered, I'd gone back to work and missed the message. Been with them 3 months now and we still don't have functional email.

Also, beware of the 45 day cancellation policy. It sounds great, if you are transferring a domain, you can't transfer it again for 60 days, so you're stuck with them.

So, long story short, if you actually do business on your website and need to be able to send/receive email from customers then the hostgator is not the place for you. I'm not sure where we'll move to, but we'll be eating the investment and moving our hosting this week.

"Been a client of Hostgator since 2011 on a shared hosting plan. Everything was fine for our purposes until last fall (2019). Email server issues with MSN accounts rejecting emails from Hostgator's email servers (thus getting bounce-back email messages because Hostgator's multiple email server IP's have been flagged for a number of spam reasons by other Hostgator clients). Hostgator advised in the end to upsell to an email plan, which isn't financially viable for running a number of nonprofits on the shared hosting account that uses a handful of emails at low volume activity. Tech support for the most part is good (after a string of emails some resolve if the phone tech is unable to resolve), polite and knowledgeable techs, etc. etc.. Pricing has naturally increased over the near decade of service. As well I see other changes coming, and other changes not happening (i.e. not using the preferred version of PHP for Wordpress) which I'm not too keen on. It was a good run while it lasted. Been through this before with another hosting service. Time to move on.

HostGator Review RESPONSE

Hi Dan,

Oh no! We really don't want to see you go. We'd love to discuss this with you and see what we can do to keep you as a client. Please drop us an email to reputation@endurance.com and provide the primary email address on your account and the best phone number to reach you and we'll see what we can do.

Please know that we have been working away at updating all our servers to the latest version of PHP, it's been a bit slow going because we don't want to break peoples website who have plugins that aren't compatible.

We look forward to hearing from you.

"I used HostGator a couple years ago, and it was a fantastic experience. Shortly after my purchase I had someone call me offering help. It was great. I used them for a few months, and then the project I was working on didn't come to fruition so I closed the website.

Now, April 2020, I have a new project, and decided to be loyal, and return to the company that was once great to me. Within 40 minutes I realized that the site I made in their Website Builder wasn't publishing properly, so I contacted their support. The support agent I had took about 5 minutes between each message. It took 20 minutes alone to get me verified, despite the fact I had to log in to use the live chat. After about an hour of being in the chat, while they couldn't figure out what was going on, I decided I'd just cancel, and go somewhere else. I told them that I wanted to cancel, and then suddenly my site is working again, and everything is fine.

I decided I'd keep trying their service, because I do have the 45 days. I decided to use their 1 click install to get MediaWiki on the website. Go through the 2 steps to get it installed, and it gives me an error when I try to access it. I contact support again. This time saying I want to cancel, and tell them what's going on. They offer to be on chat and walk me through the steps of installing it with me, but it's literally steps like type the directory you want to make, and what's your username. I tell them I just want a refund, and they start the process. About 10 minutes later a thing on my screen pops up saying that I've been disconnected because the chat was inactive. I reconnect again, wait out the 5 minute waiting period for the 3rd time in one day, and get someone that can help me. After about 20 minutes in that chat, I get my refund. The refund itself will be 5-7 business days.

Hi William,

We're disappointed to hear that you weren't satisfied with your experiences with our site and our support teams. We would love to have been able to make things work for you, but you decided to go ahead and cancel, so we can't do that. We wish you well with your new provider. We're still here if you change your mind. Thanks.

"I had been with Hostgator for quite a number of years. Back in the day, their support and service was outstanding.

Something changed, and now I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. I had missed a couple of payments and in the old days you got suspended and got to catch up the payments to bring the sites back up - which is more than fair.

NOW, for whatever reasons, the same happened and good Ole Hostgator Completely Wiped out my Hosting Account. My Sites and Client Sites have simply been deleted without any notification. No reminders, Zilch.

To me that clearly shows they have total disrespect for their clients, long or short term. It doesn't matter.

I would highly recommend that you stay very clear of this company.

I had to help rescue a friend from Hostgator, who could not ( or simply didn't know how to ) update PHP above 7.1. After a long battle with them, they managed to get it up to PHP v7.2.4 which beggars belief.

Yet, another reason to stay away from Hostgator.

They need to take a very hard long look at themselves.

HostGator Review RESPONSE

Hi Tim & All,

We generally give a 10 day grace period on invoices before suspending service. We then send out 3-4 past due reminders and data is kept on our servers for 45 days post suspension. We took a look into your account and it was cancelled in December 2019, but you never contacted us until April 28, 2020. We're disappointed that you didn't contact us sooner so that we could accept payment and restore your sites.

All of our policies about payments, cancellations and data are publicly available to you and all customer here: https://www.hostgator.com/tos and you agreed to the Terms of Service when you signed up with HostGator.

We would like to call your attention to two specific items.

Section 12 point D:
Late Payment.
All invoices must be paid within ten (10) days of the invoice due date. Any invoice that is outstanding for more than ten (10) days may result in the suspension or termination of Services. Access to the account will not be restored until payment has been received. If you fail to pay the fees as specified herein, HostGator may suspend or terminate your account and pursue the collection costs incurred by HostGator, including without limitation, any arbitration and legal fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees. HostGator will not activate new orders or activate new packages for customers who have an outstanding balance on their account.

Section 14, point H:
Termination
HostGator may terminate your access to the Services, in whole or in part, without notice in the event that: (i) you fail to pay any fees due; (ii) you violate this Agreement; (iii) your conduct may harm HostGator or others or cause HostGator or others to incur liability, as determined by HostGator in our sole discretion; or (iv) as otherwise specified in this Agreement. In such event, HostGator shall not refund to you any fees paid in advance of such termination, and you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such termination. Additionally, HostGator may charge you for all fees due for the Services for the remaining portion of the then current term.

UPON TERMINATION OF THE SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, USER CONTENT, USER WEBSITES, AND OTHER DATA WILL BE DELETED.

All of this to say, that we feel we give ample notice of past due bills and we retain data for more than a month to allow customers to catch up on payments and we feel this is more than fair.

We're very disappointed that you had this experience, but we stand behind our policies. We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts and wish you well in your future endeavors.

"A very cheap and malicious company. The customer support might be free, but it's below par. Their services are terrible. For their baby plan they only provide 100,000 for 20GB! That is a rip off. They use these malicious scams with intent to make sure your $12 a month looks like you should be only paying $2 since you can't reach the 20 GB a month because the 100,000 inodes will fill up quicker than you can even reach 3 GB of storage.

Use digital ocean! They are a much better company and provide much better services"
"I got a reseller package from Hostgator on sale. It was not noticeable at the beginning but once some websites started getting more traffic it turned out that it's really unstable. Either WHM or global database would go down taking all websites with it and there's nothing you can do except waiting until it comes back up.

I tried contacting support and it's useless. Using super slow chatbots that give you responses from KB that do noth

I'm migrating out right now and warn you to stay away from this garbage."
Been trying to get a couple of email account up and running with these guys for several weeks now. I constantly have to repeat things because their tech support has no idea what they are doing. One tech will tell you one thing and the next will tell you just the opposite. I am so glad i did not go for the long term option with hostgator. I am currently looking for new host.
"I am very surprised reading this review and can only assume I am one of the few that has had a bad experience although I doubt it as when you Google HostGator reviews you can see thousands of other unhappy customers.

I suspect this website earns a decent commision from HostGator through referrals. I also suspect they only approve the good reviews... we will see.

I signed up after reading this review. I decided on the Cloud package which would have suited my needs. After paying my money and receiving my welcome emails I thought everything was smooth and quick. I then received an email asking me for proof of my identity. I sent over a scanned copy of my passport thinking that the verification process would be quick. This is where I was sadly wrong. After waiting for over 8 hours I contacted the live support that they claim here is great. The live support were unable to help me, they said the verification team are only able to access that information and only they could approve my account. They had no problem taking my money and passport photo though. After waiting for over 24 hours and not being able to crack on with my new website I decided to go elsewhere. I asked Live Support for a refund and for them to close my account and they told me it will take 7-10 days to process and that I need to respond once again to the open ticket that originally requested my ID, the very same one that is still unanswered! This company is awful, read up on other review websites that are in no way affiliated with HostGator for some real and genuine user reviews."
"Hostgator has been consistent in delivering the bare minimum. If that's all you need, then they would be a perfect company to work with.

Pros: The up-time is great. Lots of options. Cheap

Cons: Poor customer support. This needs explanation. They answer, they promise, they confuse tickets, they don't usually deliver what they say they would, however, they are polite.

I just moved over to a dedicated server and it's been a week without any movement despite the fact that they've told me on each occasion that I call that I am a priority....a priority yet 7 day and nothing."
"I don't normally write ""good"" reviews and i think everyone is the same, thats why researching for things is a nightmare cause you only going to get the Bad raps. Honestly, if you are just making a website and want it to work, you can’t go wrong with HostGator. Stop doing you head in with reviews, its mostly mad people who have had a bad day. i have never waited more then 2-3 mins for support and always get long ass emails from support at hostgator.

My website works well and speed is not bad. By the way, I contact them from Australia, so i'm assuming people are working around the clock."
"I've used hostgator since 2011 and never had any serious issues with them - until recently the last time I contacted support was in 2010. But with the new GDPR laws I have been trying to find out what I can do about their collection of my site visitors IP addresses. Support was polite, but didn't seem very knowledgeable about it, and eventually told me that IP addresses are not considered personal data by GDPR (despite everyone else in the internet world saying they are). I'm going to try support one more time, but if I can't get anywhere I may be looking for a new host."
"I am with Hostgator now for 2 years and I had so many errors with them on their part that it is unbelievable. In the moment of writing this my site is down as their system did not renew SSL certificate automatically. Support is polite but I am having troubles explaining issues to them and I really wonder do they have any knowledge to provide support. Also, bare in mind that if you want to install additional SSL certificates for multiple domains you have to pay for them as they have removed SSL/TLS option from cpanel. I use cloud hosting there and I really wonder sometimes is there any real difference when compared to shared plans.

and if someone from Hostgator read this here is chat ID: 00001aDJB79112AR

Man, you were so good. What happened to you Hostgator?"
Hostgator support desk will typically in my experience not reply to emails for over 15 hours if at all. My websites were down for two days and their notification was an email which went to my junk folder. Despite cleaning up the websites and notifying them many times over a 15 hour period nobody answered (this has happened in the past too). Their live chat is reasonably responsive and helpful but can't do anything to help with situations like this so you are left with nobody to talk to and all email and websites down.
"A day in the life of a HostGator customer...

I need an SSL certificate, buy a third party one. I get the CSR and RSA from my reseller account.

Like so many times before, I submit the 3rd party certificate install request, especially mentioning that all files – certificate, bundle, RSA are in the home directory, just the way they like it.

Then I am waiting for the ticket confirmation. Checking spam filter – nothing. Usually, it comes after a few minutes. I look for the support tickets and cannot find them, also not the old tickets which often contain valuable information. After 90 minutes I go on the chat. The friendly tech support lady confirms that a ticket was created 90 minutes ago and that the confirmation email has not been sent out. She does not know why it hasn’t been sent and how to access neither the ticket nor the old tickets.

She offers to install the certificate and I give her the same credentials that are in the ticket, also mention that the new certificate, bundle, and RSA key are in the home directory.

After 10-15 minutes she asks me to verify that the certificate works.

I check and notice that she did not install the provided certificate, but a free Let’s Encrypt certificate.

Upon my objection and a bit back and forth, she finally forwards my request to the next support level. She actually tried to talk me into a free certificate although I had provided a paid one!

Another tech support agent contacts me about four hours later to install the certificate.

Scenarios like this have happened several times to me over the last years. Support at HostGator has been questionable for years. Considering they raised the price on my reseller account 20%, I wonder why such a big company is unable to provide better service.

A working ticket system is a MUST."
"Do not use Hostgator for web hosting. If your website ever has an issue, the support takes forever because you wait in a large queue to get help. They cost my business a lot of money on multiple occasions. They are a very large hosting company, and if you have any issues with your website, you will be placed into a huge queue and the issues will not be resolved for a few days at best depending on the issue. When you call support, you talk to lower level support that isn't able to handle your technical issues. Lower level support just takes information and then inputs it into a ticket queue until the admin support can finally get around to handling the issue. First in first out in their queue.

On a few different occasions, Hostgator had issues installing my SSL certificate. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal, but my website is how I make a living and my website was down for a few days. When an SSL certificate is down, like many know, an internet browser tells someone trying to access the website that the website is not safe/secure. This is what happened to my website and I kept getting several emails about this from customers and I ultimately lost customers and a good amount of money. Not good at all for business.

Then, I switched hosting to WPX Hosting, and they are amazing!!! I could not believe the amazing quality of WPX Hosting support. They respond within 30 seconds on the live chat every time and they fix any issues immediately. WPX Hosting is also extremely fast compared to Hostgator if you own a Wordpress website. At WPX, I was able to install an SSL within a few minutes. Now I realize that Hostgator was just telling me SSL certificates take a few days to activate because the Hostgator admins didn't have time to get to my ticket in the queue.

In addition, I paid about $1,100 up front for three years of VPS hosting with Hostgator. When I cancelled about 1/2 of the way through, of course Hostgator has a no refund policy. It is not fair to the consumer, even though I agreed when I signed up. Learning experience on my part.

Either way, Hostgator is decent in some areas, but I would say Hostgator is the worst web hosting for any website based on my experience.

I normally do not write reviews online, and I know people are probably thinking that only upset people write reviews, but I would recommend choosing another hosting company besides Hostgator. Hostgator is fine until you have an issue with your website, and if it is important that you do not have downtime on your website, I would definitely not recommend Hostgator.

Sorry Hostgator for the negative comments because I know a lot of people at your company work hard. I am very disappointed with the disconnected support system at Hostgator, and unfortunately it cost me and my business a lot of money."
"I have had years of experience with Hostgator with both a big VPS service and a smaller shared hosting service. After the acquisition by EIG Group, service quality and customer support got really bad, and I moved the VPS service to another provider. I have used the shared account for a few things and was going to cancel it this year.

I got charged five days prior to renewal (it's their policy, even if they don't send you a reminder of the automatic payment by email) and through the chat I asked for a refund because I had decided not to renew the service and it was not expired yet. The chat operator confirmed that the refund would be issued and that the account would have been available for accessing and saving data until the actual renewal date.

Today (1 day before the actual renewal date) I discovered that the account has been canceled without waiting for the natural expiration so I can't access or save the data.

Not a huge deal in my case - I already moved away most data - but the final proof that they are to be avoided at all costs.

Hope this can save you some headaches."
"I have not had any problems with hostgator and have been with them since around 2010.

they have an easy website builder, good knowledge base for learning how to do something. live chat is fast and usually fix what I need done. I only have a simple business website but it is just fine for my needs. You can pay monthly or annually for cheaper. So not sure why so many bad reviews. I would not hesitate to go with them if you are new and looking for a host."
"This is the worst hosting service out there. My sites were all hacked while on their servers, slow speeds, endless instances where they suspend my account for ""over usage"" with no way to fix the issues they say are happening without paying for extra services. I believe their company is fraudulent and is compromising accounts at the sake of selling site lock and other services. It's a nightmare. I will do everything I can to get the word out about these crooks."
"I saw a traffic spike on my website after it was linked to by a regional newspaper. Not an enormous amount of traffic but some. At the point where we were getting 20 hits a minute, they shut down the site for CPU use.

Contact with support can be summed up as - you are not entitled to CPU use ""paying for bandwidth and storage does not entitle you to processor time past a limit which we can arbitrarily set."" We won't help you when traffic spikes as a matter of policy.

Also hostgator have taken the ticket management service offline so you can't look to see what if anything they are doing to resolve your issue.

Summary of todays dealings with hostgator ""Thanks for the cash don't come looking to us for service we're not in that business."""
"Second-year hosting invoice was more than twice as much as the first-year one, so I decided to cancel. One invoice was issued to renew hosting, and a second for the domain name. The domain name is impossible to cancel. After the invoice is generated, 45 days out from the renew date, turning off auto-renew won't delete the invoice. You have to contact customer service. But customer service says they cannot cancel the invoice--the billing department has to cancel it. But the billing department can't cancel the invoice in advance of the renewal date. They can only cancel the invoice when the domain name renews--after, presumably, they've charged your credit card. Their LiveChat representatives are perfectly nice but the company's policies suck.

In terms of actual hosting, I never experienced any problems."
I have read your post and quite informative. It is a good platform to host your business website. Any startup business can get benefit by hosting their business website on this platform as they have superb run time 99.9%. I have recently hosted my business website and I found it as an ultimate source for web hosting.
"If you have not decided yet then DO NOT consider Hostgator, it will be worst decision you will ever make. I don't even know where to start, but after you sign up and past the 45 days then hell will break lose. In my case I was promised by the sales guy a 'professional looking Desktop and Mobile version' of my website. I have to admit that my desktop version looks really good, but we are now 3 months, 20 phone calls, 15 emails from customer support, 13 payment reminders and threats of suspending my account, etc... further and still no mobile version that you want to look at. I finally got to the bottom and with the software they used to built my Website (Website Builder) you can not get a decent looking tablet version, but my sales person (MIA since) 'forgot' to mention this during his sales pitch. I stopped payment and this is helping a little bit, but I don't think that they even care about that........ this organization is so unstructured, disorganized, no management, probably so overwhelmed with all the complaints that they also do not know where to start. Run while you can and do not look back........"
"Our website has been hacked. We needed a backup to restore it or the ability to access it for editing. We called in numerous occasions and they kept saying that we were not the owner of record even though our credit card keeps getting charged for $10.95 a month. Call after call. Pleading with them to assist with reset. We had to cancel the auto charge, dispute last months charge - but our website that serves over 1,000 seniors, disabled and families of low income has been done for about a month with no help from HostGator."
"The second you register your domain with them, you will get bombarded with calls from foreigners trying to develop your website. No matter how many times you tell them no, they persist. Switching numbers, switching the names of their company, trying anything and they dont take no for an answer. Highly annoying and highly unprofessional from hostmonster."
"One of the dumbest teams in the IT industry. We have been their customer for 10 years. How unfortunate for us. Certain complication preventing us from moving but soon the day is coming!

Let me just give a list of stupidy and destruction that Hostgator did to us.

1. When you need them the most during Christmas time they are understaffed with low paid employees who are not trained.

2. One of the slowest portals in the history of hosting companies. They upgraded real slow to slow. Hostgator does not know how to build products that help people. At the present day, the portal makes it impossible to navigate.

3. Do not use this company for any windows type hosting. They dont have IT staff to run the operations.

4. Hostgator turns on accounts that we do not use and charge us. They did refund it after we noticed. How many people they stole money from that did not notice. Would love to hear from its customer to see if it is possible to take Hostgator to court for years of abuse.

5. There was not one time that as a customer we could get a hold of any managers. Imagine a company having lots of problems where they shield themselves. That's Hostgator for you!

6. After refunding for fake account charges a year later they turned it back on and disconnected our site a week before Christmas. Imagine that you pay them and they turn it off on the busiest time of the year.

7. If you have any respect for your own business my best advice do not use Hostgator. They will ruin you! We have been running our other sites on Digital Ocean. For 3 years there was not one time that we had to use tech support. Smart people produce results. The uneducated team produces chaos!"
Hostgator shared hosting is worse. I purchased shared hosting and after few days I saw that shared hosting IP is blacklisted. All my site went down. In shared hosting thousand of user host their sites and if one user do some spam activity all other users site willl go down hosted on that Shared IP. Very bad service. I am on support call more than 50 minute no one picks up. I would not recommend hostgator to anyone. Very horrible service and disgusting.
"My title pretty much says it all. HostGator has been extremely professional handling anything I've thrown at them. I have many different domains with them and like to self-teach myself about all the back-end stuff by just messing around there and seeing what happens. So I'm probably not their favorite client but nonetheless, every time I've managed to mess something up they have managed to fix it. The service is good, price is good and support is great!"
"The hosting is ridiculously cheap. With that comes tech support that often has no clue and don't know what they're doing. Case in point; I needed to add a dedicated IP to one of our customers' accounts. I asked tech support whether doing this would cause any downtime for us. They said no. Several days later they email us to say the IP has been added. Lo and behold the site was down. And this customer's DNS person was not available to adjust the DNS right away, either. Utterly amateurish bunch over at HostGator."
Moved to Onsip from another provider that charged us a flat rate per month per user which seems like the industry standard. The pay as you go pricing at Onsip is saving us a decent amount of money and the solution easily integrated with our existing Polycom phones and it was easy to setup. The management interface is easy to use and easy to make any changes to the system such as moving phones around. Great cost effective phone solution for a small business like ours.
We liked the ability to add users without seat licensing cost. We really like the fact we pay for actual minutes used. It was fairly straightforward to set up the virtual PBX and program all our Polycomm phones with OnSips instructions & assistance. We had a couple of sticking point & they were quick to respond to us. We have used OnSip now for 2 years & have no plans to change; we love it.
"ONSIP was the best choice for us hands-down because of their pay as you go plan. We saved a lot of money because our call volume is relatively low, with the exception of a few sales people? but even they have been getting rid of their work cell phone plans (slowly but surely), which really saves us a lot in total. They like being able to extension dial and transfer calls to our main office. We also use MY.ONSIP to IM and see who is on the phone, etc. ONSIP was easy to set up. We use Polycoms- I highly recommend for sound quality."
"Too basic
Too basic for my taste. Majority of the book is about how to set the basic features of your blog and only a very small piece is about how to make it more successful."
"Educational
I like how he's to the point but still tell you everything. And, I will definitely be recommending this book"
"Easy to understand Step by Step
Scott Chow is very generous to share his knowledge. I have read a few books on this subject as I am getting ready to start a blog. Scott is by far the easiest to understand as well as the most encouraging."
"Good overview
Scott delivers an easy to read quick guide to setting up a blog using WordPress . I like that he plugs service providers and doesn't leave the reader wondering where to find hosting services or advertisers (for those desiring to profit from their blogs)."
"Very easy to read and follow
This guide was very easy to follow. It gave the reader a chance to see and learn each step to setting up a blog. The instructions were in the correct order, which allow the reader to create a blog along with reading the book."
"This short book was very informative and a basic guideline for starting bloggers. Although I found a few repetitive phrases/sentences to be overbearing, as well as some misplaced thoughts on varying topics within the book. I thought it was a great read to dive into a new hobby."
"Perfect for a beginner
This is a short book for the beginning blogger.Scott takes you step-by-step through the process of creating your first WordPress site and posting your first article. He then gives pointers to build your readership and monetize your blog."
"Great beginner's guide for WordPress newbies
The meat of the book is focused on WordPress, so if you're planning on using a different platform this may not be the book for you. Breaks the process of starting a WordPress blog down into easy steps."
"Starting Your Blog
I found the information in this book to be precise and understandable. I highly recommend this book to anyone with the desire and passion to start blogging. Without this help I would not have gotten started."
"Start up guide in creating a blog
Thanks for the guide of starting a blog. The content is brief though delivers the fundamentals of creating a blog. It's not difficult to read therefore great for first time bloggers. For those who need good pointers, this book help create a blog step by step. So it can help those if missed something."
"If you want to use BlueHost and Wordpress self-hosted, then this is a five-star book. If you plan to use Blogger, or whatever other option, this becomes a three-star book. The reason being that there's very little information that couldn't be found elsewhere. In fact, the book starts by directing the reader to the webpage. It's fine as a freebie. To me, it felt too much like an ad for BlueHost."
"This is a very short simple book about how to use Wordpress templates to set up a website. The reason I considered doing this is having a website where you post your reviews (other than Goodreads) increases your chances of receiving Advanced Review Copies from publishers. The book just covers the very basics, it doesn't go into Google Analytics and how to report that data to the publishers."
"Great step by step for a new blogger onnthe block.
I appreciate the clarity of this book. This was a great quick but very detailed guide with tangible results. This allows for ease of use of the recommended program for easy blog building. Having the ""how to"" section on making money over time was also a great bonus."
"For me, Rosario was not on my initial plans to visit, but I was drawn into a daylong workshop on Monetizing Your Blogging via AIRB&B. I had great 1-on-1 instruction with Sabine. You cannot beat private instruction, as it personalized my needs for only exploring a travel web site. Although I didn't take full advantage of her expertise, I do understand her instruction for business purposes. She is well versed with web hosting sites, such as Word Press."
"Little tiny book that is very helpful, simple and efficient.
I chose 4 stars for the reasonable, informative manner the material is presented. I enjoyed reading it. Perfect beginner guide. Add some deeper information about making money plus useful details about building an audience."
"We love the exit intent features on OptinMonster, it has allowed us to increase our conversion and grow our list. I will definitely recommend to any one needing to get more leads."
"OptinMonster is the best list building and lead generation tool on the market. I've tried most of the popular ones. It's lightweight, and has minimal impact page load compared to other solutions. They've been around for a long time and keep getting better. When used, your conversions will go up."
"Optinmonster is a great product for capturing email subscribers on you website. It’s simple, easy to use, and effective. I highly recommend you check it out!"
"A great, affordable tool that's easy enough for a junior level marketer to use, but sophisticated enough to keep an experienced marketer invested.

When we first started using overlays, we did it with our own custom JS. It was buggy, it took a lot of time to setup (relatively speaking), and our creative was pretty limited. I started looking for a solution, and optinmonster seemed too good to be true...it did everything our custom code did, plus more, plus it was very cheap. We signed up, and for the last few years we've been using the tool for all sorts of things.

We use the exit overlay feature the most, but we've also used the anchor/click target trigger, the time delay trigger, and the ""roll-up"" triggers for the smaller offers/sign-up boxes. To be honest, we probably haven't tested enough of the tools/features they offer, but we've been happy with the basic features.

If we had any complaints about the tool, it's that there are too many things available. We don't really need all the integrations, the scheduling or specific page features (we usually handle that in GTM with those triggers), and we feel like some of the targeting options (like referrer) are a bit too clever. We also haven't loved the WordPress plugin if/when we can use it.

Still, the value here is tremendous. We can train a new hire to start creating overlays in just a few minutes, hooking them up to MailChimp and automation sequences easy peasy. At the same time, we still find new ways to use this tool.

If you run a marketing agency like I do, you need this. If you're not running an agency but looking for a nice tool to add a bunch of smart features to your site, this one should be on your list."
"We've been using Optinmonster for a few years and it has helped us massively scale up the number of leads we've collected. Through the powerful campaign types, features and flexibility along with A/B testing, it's made a significant difference to performance. The support team are very knowledgeable and quick to respond, offering both general and very technical support."
"We're a very happy and loyal OptinMonster client! The MS.ca Team has been building awesome WP websites for years, and we started using OptinMonster back in 2014. OptinMonster is a great and trusted solution we love to implement. OptinMonster is an essential and powerful tool we use to help convert website visitors into loyal subscribers and customers. Thanks Thomas Griffin and the entire OptinMonster Team for the great product and great support!

"I wish we would have started using this sooner! We have been using OptinMonster on our site for a few weeks now and the results have been amazing. The platform is super easy to use and it has a ton of options to customize every single aspect of your campaigns. Plus, any time I have a question and can't find it in their extensive Help section, the team is eager to help."
"It was really easy to integrate OptinMonster into our website, and with the onboarding programme we got a flying start. New leads started coming in almost right away!"
"OptinMonster is user friendly, great fast support, a lot of options (triggers, mobile specific campaigns), YES/NO buttons, easy split tests. It has an affordable price."
"I needed a solution that did exactly what it said on the box. I've tried a bunch of different tools but my journey stopped with OptinMonster. The UI is really well thought out and the functionality is flawless.

Nice one team!"
good program. I am happy with the app and the support.
I love using OptinMonster on my site! (shemeansblogging.com) Every email form has a specific purpose and can be strategically used for potential leads. Totally recommend to anyone who wants to leverage their website visitors and turn them into targeted leads. The best part is that you can deeply customize every form for a great user experience and don't bother your site users with dull-looking forms the minute they land on the site. LOVE it!
OptinMonster is one of the best tools for smart marketers. The potential is unlimited – thanks to lot of options and settings you can fit it to your business perfectly.
"OptinMonster is awesome! We were having trouble growing our email list on our website and came across OptinMonster as a solution. We are so glad we did! We averaged 10 new sign-ups a month before OptinMonster. We are now getting over 150 sign-ups a month! We also use it to help people navigate to our application page and we are seeing tremendous results from those campaigns as well. 
They have an amazing customer service team, too! My only regret is that we didn't find them soon."
"I've tried a lot of different solutions in terms of growing my email list. So far, in terms of value for money - OptinMonster is my favorite.

- Also they were super helpful with my onboarding and helping me set up my campaigns and split test!

Good job guys!"
"Best app for pop-ups! I am using it on all of my websites for upselling, cross-selling and lead generation. The level of customization and ways to target is enormous and super user-friendly. Well done!"
"Their features are very good. Furthermore, instructions on how to use any features are very easy to follow."
Spent five hours attempting to integrate Optinmonster and to no avail.  Customer service appears to be incompetent.  Suggested I call back in the morning.  BEWARE!
"Great product. TERRIBLE customer service.

We were an early user of OptinMonster, so when they changed all their plans and increased prices they kept us on a Legacy plan. 

However, we had a blunder and missed our annual renewal reminders as the notification email account was no longer active. As soon as we realised our account was suspended we logged in and tried to renew, however it wouldn't let us renew our previous Legacy plan. It was making us renew for double the cost with 3 websites instead of UNLIMITED.

I contacted Support and they refused to put us back on our previous plan. They claimed that the system wouldn't allow it, and it's not possible because of a PayPal restriction.

After 2 weeks we finally gave up and paid for a new account at a much higher price. 

Very frustrating, but got over it and moved on...

Until, literally a few weeks later I get an email on another OptinMonster account I no longer use, offering me 90% off ANY PLAN if I ""come back to OptinMonster"".

So it turns out, existing loyal customers get screwed, and they're not willing to offer you any deals. But if you cancel your account, they'll send you a 90% discount offer.

Stay away from these guys, their tactics are dishonest and they don't deserve your business."
"The worst popup platform ever.
Time delay don't even work. So many problems, and bad customer service.
So many better alternatives."

What You Should Look for In a Web Host
In a previous post, I outlined a series of important checkpoints to help you know what to look for in a web host. You may read a good review on A2 Hosting or any others today, and their servers can operate poorly months down the line. I don't want you to feel stuck following others' recommendations without having a good template of what to look for yourself. In summary, you should look for:

1. Speed

2. Uptime

3. Good Customer support

4. Features that will help you to maximize your presence online

5. Security

6. Storage space

7. Integrity

Choosing a web host is a big decision if you plan to invest your time creating and uploading content online, or if you plan to invest your money to pay someone else to do it. You don't want to choose a web host based on the wrong metrics. To read the full post about how to choose a good web host, CHECK OUT THE FULL ARTICLE HERE.
What is A2 Hosting? An Overview
A2 Hosting was started back in 2001 by Bryan Muthig. He was a technology professional, having a background as a UNIX system administrator, and he decided to transfer his expertise into his own company. When he started A2 Hosting 18 years ago, he called it ""Iniquinet"", and since they've rebranded.

The rebranding was probably a good move. Haha. Who would remember how to pronounce Iniquinet?

Many internet marketers complain about hosting companies who are being bought out by major publicly traded companies because they're:

 	Buying the smaller hosting companies
 	Wiping out their support staff
 	Increasing the affiliate commissions
 	and changing good names into lackluster performing businesses

So, it's good to note that A2 Hosting is privately owned, and has been that way since they started. Their support is 100% US based, so it's not a big communication lapse where the business operates in one location and the support is overseas. As a result, if you place a support ticket, the communication is quick and your problem can be resolved very fast.
How Does A2 Hosting Work?
In it's simplest form, website hosting is paying for space on a server to ensure your website is live for your visitors when they want to see it. A2 Hosting has a network of servers in the US (in Michigan), in Europe (in Amsterdam), and in Asia (in Singapore). As a result, they can provide quick serving of your website data to internet users all over the world.

While my preferred content management system is WordPress, A2 Hosting offers WordPress hosting and so much more! If you prefer an alternative to WordPress, A2 Hosting may be a good option for you. They host:

 	Joomla
 	Magento
 	Drupal
 	b2evolution
 	Concrete5
 	Forum CMS
 	CRM CMS
 	E-Commerce CMS (like Prestashop, Magento, Woocommerce, etc.)
 	and, so many more content management system options!

How Do I Get Started with A2 Hosting?
So, if you're in the situation we described above where you're looking for a way to start your website or grow your website, and you're thinking A2 Hosting is the best option for you. You'd get started by...
1. Choosing an A2 Hosting plan
The A2 Hosting plans vary by:

 	How many websites you plan to create
 	Whether you want shared hosting, VPS, or a dedicated server
 	and whether you want the turboservers or not

If you're just starting out, and you want to host one website, you can choose their smallest shared hosting plan, and it should be sufficient for you. If you have a larger website with more content and traffic, you may want VPS or a dedicated server. Check out my post on how to choose the best hosting for you if you want to understand the differences. If you want more websites, you might be best off choosing their shared or VPS plans where you'd be able to host unlimited websites. Only very established sites will require dedicated servers, but if that's you, A2 Hosting still has a package option you can pick.
2. You Transfer your existing site (with A2 Free migration) or you Install a CMS
A2 Hosting offers free migration, so if you currently have a web host, and you want to switch to A2 Hosting, they make the switch very easy for you. You'd contact the A2 Hosting support letting them know which hosting account you'd like the site transferred to.

If you're new online, you'd need to buy a domain name and install a content management system. For the ease of this tutorial, I'll explain a WordPress installation. A2 Hosting uses a three-click website builder named Softaculous. Once you're logged onto your A2 Hosting account, you'd go to Softaculous, and install WordPress.
3. Begin Customizing your site
Once you have a live website on A2 Hosting, you're all set and ready to begin customizing your website!

Here's a video walkthru to show you how you'd set up a website on A2 Hosting:


Who is A2 Hosting For?

 	Those who want the flexibility to use various content management systems (WordPress and others)
 	Those who want quick customer support
 	Website owners who want a hosting company they'll be able to grow with: from 0 to millions of visitors
 	Those who want to resell hosting to others (A2 offers reseller hosting)
 	and, Those who understand the importance of page speed to their rankings and overall business undertakings online

A2 Hosting Tools &amp; Training
While A2 Hosting offers a superior level of support, speed, and quality services, they don't offer much training for newbies or businesses who are aspiring to grow online. If you want to understand SEO, social media marketing, paid advertising, or other techniques to maximize your use of the internet, you'd have to find that outside of A2 Hosting.

They do offer tutorials and support to help you get your site live and keep it live though!
A2 Hosting Support
Customer reviews suggest A2 Hosting is outstanding. They've been in business for 18 years, so it wouldn't be surprising to find one customer complaint here or there, but A2 has a amazing reputation for good customer support!
What Does A2 Hosting Do Well

 	They provide quick and knowledgeable support
 	They host many different content management systems (CMS)
 	They maintain their servers very well so they keep a 99% or higher uptime
 	They give users C-Panel access so if you want to do customizations, you have access
 	They offer lots of security preventative features to prevent malware attacks or hackers

What Doesn't A2 Hosting Do Well

 	They don't provide internet marketing training or tools to maximize your reach online
 	Although testers have noted their uptime ranks among the highest, they don't have the #1 highest uptime of all web hosting companies online

Their Uptime and Speed Tests
Hostingfacts has been performing a test on A2 Hosting since 2015 where they've purchased a domain and publically share their uptime and speed data. You can see the results of their speed tests and uptime data since 2015 here.  It's pretty good!
Common Positive Feedback

 	Very good customer support
 	They always respond quickly to support tickets
 	They perform better than most (and sometimes all) web hosts on speed tests
 	They're versatile
 	Technical support is very knowledgeable

Common Negative Feedback

 	They've had ebbs and flows where uptime will go between 99.1% to 99.9%. For some 99.1% uptime is alarming.

Most Helpful Positive A2Hosting Review
HostingFacts has been a paying customer of A2 Hosting since 2015. Their review reflects their testing on their A2 Hosted sites. Here's what they said:

""A2 Hosting page loading times came in with an average of 376ms over a period of TEN months – the highest of every web host we have reviewed – and 50+ percent faster than the industry average (890ms). ""
Most Helpful Negative A2Hosting Review
In his video review comparing uptime data and page load speeds, Darrell Wilson showed Siteground and Dreamhost performed better on page speed tests. His experience may be different than yours, and the page speed was within seconds of a difference. You can see all of the data from his comparison tests here:


A2Hosting Price
Shared Hosting Plans
A2 Hosting has three shared hosting plans: 1-site, 3-sites, and unlimited sites.  The pricing breaks down like this:


VPS Hosting Plans
VPS hosting means you'd have a server that's shared with less website owners than a shared hosting plan.  These plans range from $5/mo (for unmanaged VPS hosting) to $70/mo for Windows managed VPS hosting.  They offer plans priced at $32.99, $36.99, $49.49, and $69.29. CHECK OUT THEIR PLANS AND PRICING HERE.
Dedicated Server Hosting
Dedicated hosting would mean your websites will have their own dedicated server. You'll have much more storage space and you won't have to worry about sharing a server with someone who might have unethical internet marketing practices. As a result, you won't have to worry as much about your email being automatically sent to a spam box or something like that. Dedicated hosting at A2 Hosting starts at $141.09/mo. CHECK OUT THEIR DEDICATED HOSTING PLANS HERE.
My Final Opinion of A2Hosting
Overall, A2 Hosting is a great option for those who want to start a website or those with an existing website who want great customer service, great technical experts supporting them, and a high-quality hosting service. This is one of the hosts with the top performance and the most satisfied customers. If you'd like to give A2Hosting a try, CREATE YOUR A2 HOSTING ACCOUNT HERE.
